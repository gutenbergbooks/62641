<p class="pcapc"><b>Cover Photo: THE CASTLE</b>, five miles west of Cedar Pass and just west of Norbeck
Pass, is a spectacular saw-tooth ridge which was named by early local ranchers. The
spires rise more than 200 feet above the Fossil Exhibit Trail (see <a href="#fig28">Figure 28</a>) and approximately
450 feet above the lower grassland plains which are out of view on the left.
The ridge is an eroded remnant of rock layers which formerly covered Badlands National
Monument and surrounding areas.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>In 1951 the National Park Service (NPS) launched the concept of
developing a documented history for each unit of the national park system.
Known since 1984 as &ldquo;park&rdquo; histories, the studies were to be general
in scope, spanning the history of each area with emphasis on park
origin, legislation, visitor use, and all aspects of management.</p>
<p>Although sporadic research on local area history was done by the
NPS in the 1950&rsquo;s and early 1960&rsquo;s, comprehensive research studies
that finally led to a park history for Badlands National Monument did
not start until 1964. In that year Ray H. Mattison, former Visitor Services
Coordinator and Historian for the Midwest Region of the NPS, began
the project by selecting some 300 pages of reference materials from
the National Archives. Additional bibliographical materials were located
in the Congressional Record, NPS historical files, and elsewhere.
Former Chief Park Naturalist Robert A. Grom of Badlands National Monument
did much in gathering photographs, maps, and historical data, and
in writing additions and revising parts of the various drafts prepared
by Mattison. By the end of 1965 a manuscript was completed, but publication
was delayed. Mattison retired from the NPS in 1965 and Grom
was transferred in May 1966.</p>
<p>In 1967 more historical evidence came to light which resulted in
the editing, updating, and expanding of the 1965 manuscript. Much
of this work was done by Joanne W. Stockert, wife of the Chief Park
Naturalist. Copies of all documents and references not found locally
but which were used as bibliography in the final manuscript were
obtained for the files or library of Badlands National Monument. For
those who are interested in learning how this national monument has
evolved to the present time, the Badlands Natural History Association
has published this history with the hope that it will provide a basic
source of historical information on Badlands National Monument.</p>

<p class="pcapc">This is the earliest published view of the White River Badlands. The sketch was made in 1849 by Dr. John
Evans when he was in the field with the Owen Geological Survey. The region at that time was a part of
Nebraska Territory.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">EARLY INDIANS AND EXPLORERS</span></h2>
<p>Little is known of the prehistory of the region which comprises Badlands
National Monument. The time of man&rsquo;s entry into the Badlands-Black
Hills region is unknown. The oldest Indian site found in western
South Dakota is in the Angostura Basin south of Hot Springs. Studies
indicate it to be a little more than 7,000 years old. Evidence shows that
these early people were big-game hunters who preyed upon mammoth,
large bison, and other animals that lived in the lush post-glacial grasslands.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Firepits containing Indian artifacts have been found in the Pinnacles
area of the national monument. Radiocarbon studies leave little doubt
that hunters were already using this site by 900 A.D.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> More archeological
research will probably show that man hunted and made his
home in the Badlands long before that date.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Since about 1000 AD. the Black Hills area has been occupied by a
number of nomadic Indian tribes. Some of these subsisted primarily
by hunting, while others lived on local food plants. These tribes probably
belonged to the Caddoan, Athabascan, Kiowa, and Shoshonean
linguistic groups.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>During the 18th century, parties of Arikara from the Missouri River
went on buffalo hunts as far west as the Black Hills. There they met
with the Comanche, Arapaho, Kiowa, and Cheyenne at trading fairs
where they acquired horses. The Arikara, in turn, traded horses with
the Teton Sioux who had been slowly migrating south and westward
since about 1670 from the headwaters of the Mississippi River. Around
1775 the Oglala and Brule, tribes of the Teton Sioux, moved west of the
Missouri River to occupy respectively the Bad River country (around the
present town of Philip, S.D.) and the region along the White River
south of the Badlands. Because of their move from a timbered area
to a plains region, the Sioux underwent great adjustment. As the result
of acquiring guns from the whites and horses from other tribes, the Sioux
became primarily a nomadic people, dependent on buffalo for sustenance.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>For more than a century prior to 1763, the upper Missouri Valley, including
what is today Badlands National Monument, was under French
control. Under terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1763 French possessions
west of the Mississippi River were ceded to Spain. Spain returned the
area, known as Louisiana, to France in 1800 in the secret Treaty of
San Ildefonso.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> In 1803 the entire region, which included all of the
present states of Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota,
plus parts of eight other states, was purchased by the United States from
France for $15,000,000.</p>
<p>The early French-Canadian trappers called the region, which includes
the present day national monument, <b>Les Mauvaises terres a
traverser</b>, which translated means &ldquo;bad lands to travel across.&rdquo; Other
traders applied the term &ldquo;bad lands&rdquo; to this locality as well as to any
section of the prairie country &ldquo;where roads are difficult....&rdquo; The Dakota
Indians called the region <b>Mako Sica</b> (mako, land; sica, bad).<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Father Pierre-Jean de Smet called the White River <b>Mankizita-Watpa</b>.
This Indian word commonly means &ldquo;white earth river,&rdquo; or more literally,
&ldquo;smoking land river.&rdquo; The priest attributed the name to the river water
which he wrote was &ldquo;impregnated with a whitish slime.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Early American trappers and traders called the attention of the
world to the unusual geological features and extensive fossil deposits
of the Badlands along the White River. The earliest known description
of the region, believed to be the White River Badlands, is that of James
Clyman, a member of Jedediah Smith&rsquo;s 11-man party, who passed
through the area in 1823. Clyman described it as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... a tract of county whare no vegetation of any kind existed
beeing worn into knobs and gullies and extremely uneven ... a
loose grayish coloured soil verry soluble in water running thick
as it could move of a pale whitish coular and remarkably adhesive ...
there [came] on a misty rain while we were in this pile
of ashes [bad-lands west of the South Fork of the Cheyenne
River] and it loded down our horses feet (feet) in great lumps
it looked a little remarkable that not a foot of level land could
be found the narrow revines going in all manner of directions
and the cobble mound[s] of a regular taper from top to bottom
all of them of the percise same angle and the tops sharp ... the
whole of this region is moveing to the Misourie River as fast as
rain and thawing of Snow can carry it....<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Maximilian, Prince of Wied, returned to Fort Pierre in 1834
after making his historic journey up the Missouri with Charles Bodmer,
William Laidlaw, the trader of the fort, gave him a description of the
Badlands. The German prince wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... I much regretted that I could not remain long enough to
visit the interesting tract of the Mauvaises Terres, which is some
days&rsquo; journey from hence. Mr. Laidlow [sic], who had been
there in the winter, gave me a description of it. It is two days&rsquo;
journey, he said, south-west of Fort Pierre, and forms, in the
level prairie, an accumulation of hills of most remarkable forms,
looking like fortresses, churches, villages and ruins, and doubtless
consisting of the same sand-stone as the conformations near
the Stone Walls. He further stated that the bighorn abounds
in that tract.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Father de Smet visited the Badlands region in 1848. He described it as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... the most extraordinary of any I have met in my journeys
through the wilderness.... Viewed at a distance, these lands
exhibit the appearance of extensive villages and ancient castles,
but under forms so extraordinary, and so capricious a style of
architecture, that we might consider them as appertaining to
some new world, or ages far remote.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Jesuit noted further, &ldquo;The industry of the settler will never succeed
in cultivating and planting this fluctuating and sterile soil....&rdquo;
However, he believed that the fossil deposits in the region would be of
interest to the geologist and the naturalist.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 2<span class="center"> OREODONT SKELETON</span></p>
<p class="pcapc">Oreodonts are the most common fossil mammals found in the Badlands. Several species
of these now-extinct animals have been scientifically described.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
</div>
<p>In the 1840&rsquo;s the reports of fossil remains in the White River Badlands
aroused the curiosity of scientific circles in the East. In the fall
of 1843(?) Alexander Culbertson, well-known fur trader of the American
Fur Company, made a trip from Fort Pierre to Fort Laramie. Either on
this particular trip or succeeding ones, he made a collection of fossils
and bones in the Badlands.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> This collection provided the basis for the
first scientific description of a Badlands fossil. The description was
written by Dr. Hiram A. Prout of St. Louis, published in 1846, and printed
again in 1847 with greater detail. The paper described a lower-jaw fragment
of a large rhinoceros-like animal which later was given the common
name <b>titanothere</b> by Dr. Joseph Leidy in 1852. Another fossil from this
same collection, a fragment of an ancestral camel, was also described
in 1847 by Dr. Leidy, who in a few years became the authority on Badlands
fossils and an outstanding paleontologist.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> In the fall of 1847
the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia became the first known
institution to receive a collection of fossils from this region.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>In 1848 another deposit to this institution, made by Culbertson&rsquo;s
father, Joseph, included &ldquo;a new fossil genus of Mammalia, found near
the &lsquo;Black Hills&rsquo;....&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> These deposits aroused such interest that in
1849 United States Geologist David Dale Owen sent his assistant, Dr.
John Evans, to the Badlands.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>Dr. Evans, accompanied by a fellow geologist, &ldquo;five Canadian
travelers who were to be our muleteers and cooks, and finally an Indian
guide and an interpreter,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> set out westward from Fort Pierre after
traveling by steamboat from St. Louis. Following five days of overland
travel they reached the Badlands. One of the party was a Frenchman,
E. de Girardin, a soldier of fortune employed as an artist on the expedition.
His story of the trip was published in 1864 in a French travel
magazine, <b>Le Tour du Monde</b>. After climbing a hill about a hundred
meters (about 330 feet) high, he beheld &ldquo;the strangest and most incomprehensible
view.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> (See <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>At the horizon, at the end of an immense plain and tinted rose
by the reflection of the setting sun, a city in ruins appears to us,
an immense city surrounded by walls and bulwarks, filled by a
palace crowned with gigantic domes and monuments of the
most fantastic and bizarre architecture. At intervals on a soil
white as snow rise embattled chateaus of brick red, pyramids
with their sharp-pointed summits topped with shapeless masses
which seem to rock in the wind, a pillar of a hundred meters
rises in the midst of this chaos of ruins like a gigantic lighthouse.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>De Girardin was also impressed by the large deposits of fossil remains
in the area. &ldquo;The soil is formed here and there of a thick bed of
petrified bones,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;sometimes in a state perfectly preserved,
sometimes broken and reduced to dust.&rdquo; The party discovered &ldquo;petrified
turtles,&rdquo; some of which were &ldquo;admirably preserved and weighing
up to 150 pounds....&rdquo; The expedition also found &ldquo;a head of a rhinoceros
equally petrified, and the jawbone of a dog or wolf of a special
kind, furnished with all its teeth.&rdquo; At places the scientists located &ldquo;heaps
of teeth and scraps of broken jawbones; ... bones and vertebrae of the
oreodon, the mastdon [sic] and the elephant.&rdquo; However, after exploring
for three days in the region without having discovered &ldquo;the elephants,
the buffaloes, and the petrified men of which they had spoken to us so
much,&rdquo; the party began its journey back to Fort Pierre.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Dr. Evans himself was not only impressed by the scenic qualities of
the Badlands but by the scientific importance of the region as well. He
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After leaving the locality on Sage Creek, affording the above-mentioned
fossils, crossing that stream, and proceeding in the
direction of White River, about twelve or fifteen miles, the formation
of the Mauvaises Terres proper bursts into view, disclosing
as here depicted, one of the most extraordinary and picturesque
sights that can be found in the whole Missouri country.</p>
<p>From the high prairies, that rise in the background, by a series
of terraces or benches, towards the spurs of the Rocky Mountains,
the traveller looks down into an extensive valley, that may
be said to constitute a world of its own, and which appears to
have been formed, partly by an extensive vertical fault, partly
by the long-continued influence of the scooping action of denudation.</p>
<p>The width of this valley may be about thirty miles, and its whole
length about ninety, as it stretches away westwardly, towards
the base of the gloomy and dark range of mountains known as
the Black Hills. Its most depressed portion, three hundred feet
below the general level of the surrounding country, is clothed
with scanty grasses, and covered by a soil similar to that of the
higher ground.</p>
<p>To the surrounding country, however, the Mauvaises Terres present
the most striking contrast. From the uniform, monotonous,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
open prairie, the traveller suddenly descends, one or two hundred
feet, into a valley that looks as if it had sunk away from the
surrounding world; leaving standing, all over it, thousands of
abrupt, irregular, prismatic, and columnar masses, frequently
capped with irregular pyramids, and stretching up to a height
of from one to two hundred feet, or more.</p>
<p>So thickly are these natural towers studded over the surface of
this extraordinary region, that the traveller threads his way
through deep, confined, labyrinthine passages, not unlike the
narrow, irregular streets and lanes of some quaint old town of
the European Continent. Viewed in the distance, indeed, these
rocky piles, in their endless succession, assume the appearance
of massive, artificial structures, decked out with all the accessories
of buttress and turret, arched doorway and clustered shaft,
pinnacle, and finial, and tapering spire.</p>
<p>One might almost imagine oneself approaching some magnificent
city of the dead, where the labour and the genius of forgotten
nations had left behind them a multitude of monuments of
art and skill.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Evans was equally awed by the rich paleontological deposits
of the Badlands region. After describing the extreme heat of the region,
he continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At every step, objects of the highest interest present themselves.
Embedded in the debris, lie strewn, in the greatest profusion,
organic relics of extinct animals. All speak of a vast freshwater
deposit of the early Tertiary Period, and disclose the
former existence of most remarkable races, that roamed about
in bygone ages high up in the Valley of the Missouri, towards
the sources of its western tributaries; where now pastures the
big-horned <b>Ovis montana</b>, the shaggy buffalo or American bison,
and the elegant and slenderly-constructed antelope.</p>
<p>Every specimen as yet brought from the Bad Lands, proves to
be of species that became exterminated before the mammoth
and mastodon lived, and differ in their specific character, not
alone from all living animals, but also from all fossils obtained
even from cotemporaneous [sic] geological formations elsewhere.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Evans drew a map (See <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>) of <b>Mauvaises Terres</b> (Bad
Lands) and Dr. Joseph Leidy prepared a catalog as well as sketches of
the most significant fossils the Owen Geological Survey Party found on
its journey to the region.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></p>
<p>In 1850 Spencer F. Baird of the Smithsonian Institution arranged
for Thaddeus Culbertson, a younger brother of Alexander Culbertson,
to visit the Badlands under the auspices of the Institution. Born in 1823
at Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, young Culbertson, a student at Princeton
Theological Seminary, set out with his brother, Alexander, from
Chambersburg in mid-February. The brothers left St. Louis by steamboat
on March 19 and arrived at Fort Pierre May 4. With his brother
supplying the equipment, Thaddeus and two others set out from the
fur-trading establishment three days later. On May 11 they encamped
at Sage Creek in the White River Badlands.<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 3<span class="center"> AN EARLY MAP OF THE WHITE RIVER BAD LANDS</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Culbertson, too, was very much impressed by the Badlands as he
approached them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The road now lay over hills which became more steep and frequent
as we approached the Bad Lands. These occasionally
appeared in the distance and never before did I see anything
that so resembled a large city; so complete was this deception
that I could point out the public buildings; one appeared to have
a large dome which might be the town Hall; another would have
a large angular, cone shape top, which would suggest the court
house or some magnificent buildings for public purposes: then
would appear a long row of palaces, great in number and superb
in all their arrangements. Indeed the thought frequently
occurred as we rode along that at a distance this portion of the
grounds looked like a city of palaces&mdash;everything arranged
upon the grandest scale and adapted for the habitation, not
of pigmies such as now inhabit the earth, but of giants such as
would be fit to rule over the immense animals whose remains
are still found there.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Culbertson was also moved by the complete desolation of the Badlands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fancy yourself on the hottest day in summer in the hottest spot
of such a place without water&mdash;without an animal and scarce an
insect astir&mdash;without a single flower to speak pleasant things
to you and you will have some idea of the utter loneliness of
the Bad Lands.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The young scientist was disappointed, however, with the fossils. Instead
of finding well-preserved skeletons of different animals, he located
only the imperfect remains of several turtles, a number of excellent teeth
and jawbones, and several good skulls of animals.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></p>
<p>After rejoining his brother at Fort Pierre, young Culbertson proceeded
up the river to Fort Union. On his trip he collected not only fossils but
skulls, skins, and skeletons of buffalo, grizzly bear, white wolf, prairie
wolf, and other animals. He also collected plants along the Missouri.
Surprisingly, the fossil remains Culbertson collected were declared by
Baird as &ldquo;an exceedingly interesting series of Mammalian and Reptilian
species including many that had never been described.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a></p>
<p>In poor health, young Culbertson died in late August 1850, soon
after his return to Chambersburg.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></p>
<p>In 1853 two geologists, Dr. F.V. Hayden and F.B. Meek, visited the
Badlands region. Both were to receive national recognition later as distinguished
scientists. They spent several days at Sage Creek, noted by
travellers for the purgative qualities of its water. Both men and their
horses experienced a weakening effect after drinking from the stream.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Brevet Brigadier-General William S. Harney&rsquo;s expedition, in its
punitive campaign against the Brule Sioux in 1855, crossed overland
through a portion of the Badlands en route from Fort Laramie (old Ft.
William) to Fort Pierre (old Fort Tecumseh) on the Missouri. Accompanying
the expedition were Lt. G.K. Warren, U.S. topographical engineer,
and Dr. Hayden who had visited the Badlands region two years earlier.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a></p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 4<span class="center"> REMAINS OF THE FORT LARAMIE-FORT PIERRE TRAIL</span></p>
<p class="pcapc">Here, just outside the most northern boundary of the present national monument, it is
believed E. de Girardin made his poetic observations of the Badlands on the horizon,
as recorded on <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a>. Wagon-wheel ruts along the old trail&mdash;in the foreground&mdash;can
still be traced for miles in unplowed terrain.</p>
</div>
<p>Warren was authorized to map the trail over which the expedition
passed. This route, which crosses the western edge of Badlands National
Monument, had been used since at least the early 1830&rsquo;s primarily by
trappers and traders to transport furs and supplies between the two forts.
Fort Pierre was abandoned as a military post in early 1857 soon after
the route was mapped, and the trail fell into disuse as a major overland
thoroughfare.<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> Remains of this historic route can still be seen.</p>
<p>Dr. Hayden and his party camped on Bear Creek, west of the present
national monument, where Alexander Culbertson, Dr. Evans, and others
had obtained their valuable collections in the 1840&rsquo;s. Dr. Hayden wrote,
&ldquo;We spent five days at this locality, and with the mammalian remains
already collected in other places, our carts were loaded to their utmost.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a>
Unlike his predecessors who had visited the region, Hayden
was favorably impressed by the White River region. &ldquo;Contrasted with
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
most of the country on the upper Missouri, The White river valley is a
paradise, and the Indians consider it one of the choice spots of earth.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a></p>
<p>Hayden revisited the White River Badlands in 1857 and in the 1860&rsquo;s.
His records may be found in government reports and in several scientific
publications.<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></p>
<p>Captain John B.S. Todd, a cousin of the wife of Abraham Lincoln
and later governor of Dakota Territory, also accompanied the Harney
Expedition of 1855 and was impressed by the scenic grandeur of the
Badlands.<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> On October 12, the day the expedition broke camp at Ash
Grove Spring (now known as Harney Spring) southeast of Sheep Mountain
Table, he recorded in his journal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After leaving camp, we continued to ascend the gentle slope
upon which it had been pitched, for nearly a mile, and on reaching
the crest, the most superbly grand and beautiful sight burst
upon our view, that my eye ever rested upon. Down for a thousand
feet and more, the road abruptly wound into the valley

<p>Beginning in 1870 other organizations began making important collections.
Among these were the United States Geological Survey, Yale
University, Princeton University, American Museum of Natural History,
University of Nebraska, Carnegie Museum, University of South Dakota,
and the South Dakota State School of Mines and Technology.<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a></p>
<p>In 1874 the Badlands were visited by the distinguished paleontologist
Dr. O.C. Marsh of Yale University and his party. At that time the Indians
in the region were in a very ugly temper as a result of the discovery of
gold in the Black Hills by the Custer Expedition. Guaranteed much of
present northwestern Nebraska and all of South Dakota west of the
Missouri by the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, they regarded white visitors
to the western Dakota region as intruders. Accompanied by an army
escort, Dr. Marsh and his party slipped into the reservation through the
Red Cloud Agency (located along the banks of the White River near
the present town of Crawford, Nebraska) at night without arousing the
Indian sentinels and reached the fossil region. Hurriedly gathering and
packing its specimens, the party returned to the agency less than 24
hours before a war party scoured the region for &ldquo;the Big Bone Chief.&rdquo;
At the agency, Chief Red Cloud informed Dr. Marsh of the manner in
which the Indian Bureau was fleecing the Indians in their rations. Dr.
Marsh carried this information to Washington, which resulted in a Congressional
investigation of the agency.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></p>

<p>Mr. John Bell Hatcher did much of the collecting for Dr. Marsh, under

to be one of the most successful and original of all collectors who have
worked in the Badlands.<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> He is responsible for beginning the practice
of collecting and preserving complete skeletons of fossilized animals.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>
<p>While considerable collecting of fossils in the Badlands has been
done by various organizations since 1870, it was conducted in a somewhat
random manner at first. Since 1899 the South Dakota State School
of Mines and Technology has sent students into the Badlands for brief
field studies.<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> However, it was not until 1924 that a systematic means of
collecting fossils in the Badlands was begun by a Princeton University
professor, Glenn L. Jepsen, who was studying at the South Dakota State
School of Mines and Technology. He organized the first School of Mines
Badlands Expedition, which met with immediate success and laid the
foundation for the present extensive paleontological collections of that
school (See <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>).<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></p>
<p>For many years large herds of bison roamed the Badlands during
the summer months. About 1861, the year that the Dakota Territory was
established, a drought began and continued for three years. The buffalo
which used the region as their summer range left during that period.
After the passing of the drought years, the herds, which had been driven
far to the west by hunters, returned only in small bands. For a time great
herds of mountain sheep, elk, antelope, whitetail and mule deer continued
to roam the area in large numbers. The elk wintered in the
southern Black Hills and went down into the Badlands in early spring.
In 1877 residents of the Rapid City area and market hunters from the
gold camps in the northern Black Hills killed large numbers, which
ended the elk migration to the Badlands. Antelope as well as whitetail
and mule deer were killed by market hunters and settlers. The mountain
sheep was the last of the big game animals to disappear.<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a></p>

<p>Predatory animals such as coyotes, wolves, and black and grizzly
bears were likewise common. Bears were exterminated early. It was
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
during the second decade of this century that coyotes and wolves disappeared
from the Badlands, largely as a result of the work of the

<p>The region which comprises western Dakota was a part of the Great
Sioux Reservation recognized as such by the Fort Laramie treaties of
1851 and 1868. In the late nineteenth century the tide of white settlement
had been steadily pushing westward. By an agreement on September
26, 1876, later formalized by U.S. Statute, the Black Hills region was
opened to white settlement. An Act of Congress approved on March 2,
1889 (the same year South Dakota became a state), and proclaimed by
President Harrison on February 10, 1890, restored to public domain the
area between the White and Cheyenne Rivers. This included the present
area of Badlands National Monument.<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a></p>
<p>On December 24, 1890, after escaping from military surveillance at
Camp Cheyenne on the Cheyenne River, Chief Big Foot and his band of
Miniconjous Sioux fled through what is now Big Foot Pass in Badlands
National Monument to the White River where they camped. When the
Indians reached Pine Creek on December 28, they were intercepted by
the army. In attempting to disarm them the next day, the military precipitated
the infamous &ldquo;Wounded Knee Massacre&rdquo; of December 29, 1890,
when more than 150 Indians and 39 whites were killed. This was the
last major clash between Indians and the United States Army.<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a></p>
<p>The famous western artist Frederic Remington was attached to a
scouting party which went into the Badlands in search of Big Foot and his
band. The first camp Remington made with the soldiers was on Christmas
night with the thermometer well below zero. In an article written for
<b>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</b>, January 21, 1891, he described his trip into the region:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was twelve miles through the defiles of the Bad Lands to the
blue ridge of the high mesa where the hostiles had lived. The
trail was strewn with dead cattle, some of them having never
been touched with a knife. Here and there a dead pony, ridden
to a stand-still and left nerveless on the trail. No words of mine
can describe these Bad Lands. They are somewhat as Dore
pictured hell. One set of buttes, with cones and minarets, gives
place in the next mile to natural freaks of a different variety,
never dreamed of by mortal man. It is the action of water on
clay; there are ashes or what looks like them. The painter&rsquo;s
whole palette is in one bluff.<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">THE SETTLERS COME</span></h2>
<p>White settlement of the Badlands region was slow. Suited for
grazing, the region in the 1890&rsquo;s was primarily the domain of cattlemen
and sheepmen. At that time the region was surveyed by the Government.<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a></p>

<p class="pcapc">Settled in about 1881, the town was known as Black until the name was changed
around 1895. It was located about two miles southeast of the present town of Interior.
In 1907, old Interior was abandoned in favor of the present townsite when the Milwaukee
Road was built.<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Bruce Siberts, a Dakota cowboy, was in the Badlands several times
during the early 1890&rsquo;s. He stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The big pasture west of the Missouri that the Sioux had turned
over to Uncle Sam had few ranchers in it when I went there in
1890, but within another year or so there were all kinds of livestock
roaming over it.<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Siberts&rsquo; acquaintance with the Badlands was the result of his experience
with cattle thieves who &ldquo;holed up&rdquo; there. The outlaws, after
stealing Siberts&rsquo; cattle, drove them to the Badlands.</p>
<p>Siberts started out in pursuit. During a week&rsquo;s stay in the Badlands,
he saw thousands of head of stock, many of which were unbranded.
Unable to recover his stolen cattle, he returned to his home on Plum
Creek, a tributary of the Cheyenne River. He obtained a companion
and went back to the Badlands. There the two men built several horse
traps, captured a number of unbranded horses, branded them, and later
sold the horses for $600.<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a> Siberts returned alone to the region the following
year to obtain more unbranded horses, but lost his horses to
outlaws. As a result he was left afoot many miles from home. Siberts
succeeded in taking the horse of Bill Newsom, head of a group of cattle
rustlers, and made his way to a railroad town in Nebraska. He returned
to South Dakota by rail.<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a></p>

<p>Isolated from natural transportation routes, few settlers moved into
the region until the coming of railroads. In 1907 the Chicago and North
Western Railway Company built its line from Pierre through Philip and
Wall to Rapid City. During the same year, the Chicago, Milwaukee
and St. Paul Railroad Company (now known as the Chicago, Milwaukee,
St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company or, simply, the Milwaukee Road)
completed its line from Chamberlain to Rapid City along the White River
through Kadoka and Interior.<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a></p>
<p>There was considerable homestead activity in 1906 under the original
homestead law of 1862, despite the fact that the 160-acre farm unit was
inadequate in the region. Leonel Jensen, a long-time resident in the
vicinity of the Badlands, stated that when his father came to the region
in May 1906 there were few homestead buildings. In the fall of that
year there was a homestead shack on practically every quarter-section
of land, because many settlers had anticipated the coming of the railroads.<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a>
In 1912 the period to &ldquo;prove up&rdquo; on the lands was liberalized
by changing the time of residence from five to three years. The Enlarged
Homestead Act of 1909 was applied to South Dakota by Congress in
1915, enabling settlers to acquire 320 acres instead of 160.<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a></p>
<p>The homestead laws were liberalized again in 1916 by the enactment
of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act. This provided for 640-acre homesteads
on lands officially designated as nonirrigable grazing lands.<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a></p>

<p>From 1900 to 1905 the population in western South Dakota increased
from 43,782 to 57,575; by 1910 it was 137,687.<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a> From 1910 to 1930 it continued
to increase, but at a slower pace. In the decade following 1910
the population of Pennington County increased slightly from 12,453 to
12,720; by 1930 it was 20,079. In Jackson County, which contained no
urban centers, the increase was much smaller. From 1920 to 1930 (no
figures are available for 1910 to 1920) the population went from 2,472 to
2,636.<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a> For a comparison with recent trends, the populations of Jackson
and Pennington counties in 1960 were 1,985 and 58,195 respectively.<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a>
(The western or 87 percent of the present Badlands National Monument is
located in Pennington County; the eastern section is in Jackson County.)</p>
<p>Between 1910 and 1920, increasing amounts of land in western South
Dakota passed out of the public domain and into private ownership.
Encouraged by the high prices for farm and ranch products resulting
from World War I, many farmers and ranchers took advantage of the
liberalized homestead acts. By 1922 less than half of the land which was
later included in Badlands National Monument was publicly owned.<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">LEGISLATION FOR PARK ESTABLISHMENT</span></h2>
<p>Stimulated in part by various individuals and groups, the South Dakota
Legislature in 1909 petitioned the federal government to establish
a township of Badlands as a national park. As read before both houses
of Congress on March 16, 1909, the petition stated in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas there is a small section of country about the headwaters
of the White River in South Dakota where nature has
carved the surface of the earth into most unique and interesting
forms, and has exposed to an extent perhaps not elsewhere
found; and</p>
<p>Whereas this formation is so unique, picturesque, and valuable
for the purpose of study that a portion of it should be retained
in its native state....<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, no legislation was introduced on the proposal until more
than a decade later.</p>
<p>A 1919 report by the U.S. Forest Service recommended that the Badlands
area be set aside as a national park. The report also recorded
considerable tourist travel to the Badlands. &ldquo;The travel this year was
several hundred times greater than in any former year....&rdquo; Many
visitors came over state route 40 (the Washington Highway) which connects
the towns of Interior and Scenic with Rapid City. This road was
under construction in 1919 and followed, more or less, the Chicago, Milwaukee
and St. Paul Railroad. Visitors also came on passenger trains.<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a></p>
<p>However, accessibility to the scenic sections of the Badlands Wall
from the Washington Highway were already being closed in 1919 by the
construction of fences, except for a few low passes in the wall where side
roads had been constructed. The Washington Highway and the railroad
are both located two to six miles from the most picturesque Badlands
features. The same report recommended that a road be built
&ldquo;along the course of the scenic points of interest&rdquo; and that campgrounds
should be constructed &ldquo;at well chosen camp sites.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a> (Such a road was
completed 16 years later by the State of South Dakota; see <a href="#Page_43">page 43</a>).</p>
<p>While other individuals and organizations played an important part
in the establishment of Badlands National Monument, Senator Peter
Norbeck deserves more credit than any other legislator. Norbeck was
born on a farm in Clay County in southeastern South Dakota, August
27, 1870, and was the son of a member of the 1871 Dakota Territorial
Legislature. His public career began when he was elected to the state
senate in 1908 and he served there until 1915. In 1914 Norbeck was voted
lieutenant-governor of the state, and was elected governor in 1916 and
1918. His achievements as governor were many, including the founding
of a state-enterprise program designed to help farmers. Another of his
great accomplishments was the establishment of Custer State Park.</p>
<p>In 1920 Norbeck was elected to the United States Senate where he
served continuously until his death in 1936. Although his chief interest
was in farm-relief legislation, he was instrumental in passing the Migratory
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
Bird Act of 1929 and in securing federal funds for the carving of
Mount Rushmore National Memorial.<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a></p>
<p>South Dakota&rsquo;s congressmen, William Williamson from Oacoma and
Charles A. Christopherson from Sioux Falls, assisted Norbeck by their
work in the U.S. House of Representatives. Christopherson&rsquo;s services
in the House began in 1919, Williamson&rsquo;s in 1921.<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a></p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 13<span class="center"> EARLY ROAD THROUGH CEDAR PASS, 1908 or earlier</span></p>
</div>
<p>On May 2, 1922, during the second session of the 67th Congress,
Senator Norbeck introduced the first bill (S. 3541) for making the Badlands
area a national park. Entitled &ldquo;A bill to establish the Wonderland
National Park in the State of South Dakota,&rdquo; it proposed to set aside and
withdraw from entry &ldquo;all public lands lying and being within townships
two and three south, ranges fifteen and sixteen east of the Black Hills
meridian, and township three south, ranges seventeen, eighteen, and
nineteen east of the Black Hills meridian.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a> The proposal provided that
the Secretary of the Interior might add to the park from time to time any
lands which may be donated to the United States for such purposes. It
also stated that the Secretary of the Interior may authorize exchange of
non-federal lands in the park for certain public lands of equal value outside
the park. Finally, the bill provided that a sum not exceeding $5,000
annually be appropriated by Congress for the maintenance and improvement
of the park, if the State of South Dakota made an equal contribution.
After the bill was read, it was referred to the Committee of Public Lands
and Surveys.<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a></p>
<p>On the same day, Congressman Williamson introduced a bill (H.R.
11514) in the House of Representatives, identical to the first one submitted
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
by Norbeck in the Senate. This bill was referred to the Committee on
the Public Lands and ordered to be printed.<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a> No further action was
taken on either the Norbeck or Williamson bills in the 67th Congress.</p>
<p>However, in October 1922 President Harding issued an executive
order temporarily withdrawing all public lands in the seven townships
to be included in the proposed park for the purpose of classifying them
&ldquo;pending enactment of appropriate legislation.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a> The total area within
the seven townships was about 161,000 acres, of which 35,410 were classified
as vacant.<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a></p>
<p>On March 3, 1923, Congressmen Christopherson and Williamson
presented memorials from &ldquo;the Legislature of the State of South Dakota
urging Congress to set aside the Bad Lands as a national park....&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a></p>
<p>In December 1923, in the 68th Congress, Williamson again introduced
a bill (H.R. 2810) to establish Wonderland National Park. This proposal
was identical to the one he and Norbeck introduced in the preceding
Congress.<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a> Like the earlier bill it, too, died in committee.</p>
<p>If the Norbeck papers, now at the University of South Dakota, are any
indication of the public support the Senator received for his park proposal,
only a few people in the early 1920&rsquo;s shared his views. Attorney General
Byron S. Payne of South Dakota, Professor W.C. Toepelman of the
University of South Dakota Geology Department, and W.H. Tompkins of
the U.S. Land Office in Rapid City, all endorsed the Wonderland National
Park proposal.<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a> However, at that time the highways were relatively
undeveloped. The automobile industry and tourism were both
in their infancies. It was to take nearly another decade to gain the support
of local and state chambers of commerce and other promotional
groups for national parks and monuments.</p>
<p>It appears that the National Park Service did not give Norbeck encouragement
for his idea of a national park in the Badlands. In a letter
to a constituent in May 1924, the Senator wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... regarding the Bad Lands National Park, [I] will state that the
Park Service here will not approve a bill of that kind,&mdash;and
therefore, we can not secure the legislation. They are, however,
willing to approve the plan of having it designated by the President
as a &ldquo;National Monument&rdquo;. In practice, this means nearly
the same thing, so Congressman Williamson and I have come
to an agreement that we are going to accept that plan and work
it out that way.<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, Norbeck continued to work for a national park instead
of a national monument.</p>
<p>To insure that he would include the most scenic parts of the region
in the proposed park, Norbeck made frequent trips there. In answer to
a constituent&rsquo;s letter, he wrote in November 1927, &ldquo;I have visited the Bad
Lands every year for sixteen years. A year ago I spent four or five days
in them and this year I have made five trips into that area.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a>
During 1927 a number of eastern newspapers carried photographs of the Badlands
in their Sunday photo sections.<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a></p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 14<span class="center"> VAMPIRE PEAK, 1930&rsquo;s</span></p>
<p class="pcapc">Located near the present national monument visitor center, the peak has since lost its
spires to erosion. According to local tradition the presence of bats around the formation
caused J.I. Peterkin, a traveling artist, to give it this name around 1915.<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a></p>
</div>
<p>In the late 1920&rsquo;s Badlands visitors who arrived from the east via
Kadoka or Cottonwood probably used Cedar Pass. The narrow and
precipitous route through Cedar Pass was aptly described by one of
those early visitors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The passes become more crooked and the grades more steep.
The road is bordered by profuse scrub cedar trees. There is a
thrill in that drive! At first it looks dangerous, but the danger
seems to minimize as we approach each more steep and more
crooked and more narrow section. By taking it slowly the risk
is small.<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The route passed the new Cedar Pass Camp (now Cedar Pass Lodge)
and took visitors to the railroad town of Interior where they may have
spent some time at Palmer&rsquo;s Curio shop and at Henry Thompson&rsquo;s souvenir
stand which he called &ldquo;The Wonderland.&rdquo; From Interior visitors
traveled west over the Washington Highway to the railroad town of
Scenic. In the late 1920&rsquo;s the Museum Filling Station in Scenic was
widely known for its collection of Badlands fossils and Indian artifacts.
They also provided guide services to visitors desiring to see Badlands
features located off the road. Rapid City was reached by traveling northwest
over 45 miles of good dirt road&mdash;except during rains.<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a></p>
<p>Support for the park proposal grew in the late 1920&rsquo;s. In October
1927 the Wonderland Hiway Association, in a letter to Senator Norbeck,
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a meeting of the Wonderland Hiway Association, an orgization
[sic] comprising the business men and local residenters [sic]
of the Towns through the Bad Lands, It was resolved;
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
That the Association would ask and petition the State Hiway
Commission ... for a State Hiway, Starting from Kadoka, West

to Scenic over Hiway #40 and from Scenic to Hermosa, S. Dak.,
Providing a sutable [sic] location can be found.<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The State Highway Commission gave the proposal its wholehearted
support.<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a></p>
<p>The National Park Service, however, continued to oppose the area as
a national park on two grounds. For one thing much of the land was in
private ownership. Senator Norbeck explained in a 1927 letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Park program is not as easy as it seems on account of so
much of the land having gone into Private ownership. The
Federal Government will not purchase land for park purposes.
They never have. The State must and that will come slow.<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the second place, the National Park Service believed that the area
was more suitable as a national monument. The Senator continued in
the same letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Park Service is opposed to making it a National Park as they
try to limit the Parks to the areas that are principally recreational.
They would favor a plan to make the Bad Lands a
&ldquo;National Monument.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the objections of the Service to the Senator&rsquo;s park proposal,
Norbeck&rsquo;s continued desire for a national park in the Badlands was
stated in a letter written in November 1927 to Hubert Work, Secretary
of the Interior:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Congressional delegation from this state will be united in
an effort to create a Bad Lands National Park in South Dakota.
If this is impossible they will desire to have certain areas set
aside as national monuments.<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In April 1928 Norbeck wrote Representative Williamson asking him
to help draft a bill for the park. The first part of the bill, Norbeck indicated,
would &ldquo;include the Badlands Wall proper, from a point about 4
miles east of Interior to a point 12 or 14 miles southwest of Wall.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a> The
establishment of the park would be contingent on the building of a road
by the State through the proposed area and the State acquiring 90 percent
of the privately owned lands within it. The second part of the bill
would authorize a national monument which would include Sheep
Mountain and the surrounding area, some six to seven miles southwest
of Scenic. The authorization of this area would be conditional upon the
construction of a highway from Scenic to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation
and acquisition of the lands within the proposed monument by the
State of South Dakota. The third portion of the bill would authorize the
abandonment of Wind Cave National Park!<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a></p>
<p>The bills as finally presented to Congress by Norbeck and Williamson
were somewhat different from the one which the Senator planned.</p>
<p>During the first session of the 70th Congress, Norbeck and Williamson
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
introduced identical legislation in their respective houses on May 8, 1928,
to set aside the Badlands as a national park. Norbeck introduced S. 4385,
&ldquo;A Bill To establish Teton National Park in the State of South Dakota....&rdquo;
The bill authorized the Secretary of the Interior, through negotiation,
to exchange privately owned lands within the proposed park for
public lands of equal value outside. The bill contained a provision
that when 90 percent of the privately owned lands within the proposed
area had been acquired without expense to the federal treasury and
transferred to the government for park purposes, the park would be set
aside for the people, &ldquo;... <b>Provided</b>, That the State of South Dakota shall
have first constructed&rdquo; approximately 40 miles of suitable road to specified
points inside and outside the proposed park.<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a></p>

</div>
<p>Norbeck&rsquo;s bill was referred to the Committee on Public Lands and
Surveys. On May 19 the bill was reported out without amendment. The
accompanying report (No. 1246) gave a strong endorsement to the proposal.<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a>
On May 23, the bill was considered as in Committee of the
Whole and passed the Senate.<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a></p>
<p>However, in the House where Williamson had introduced an identical
bill (H.R. 13618), the park proposal ran into trouble. In a circular
letter dated November 7, 1928, the National Parks Association claimed
that the proposed Teton National Park had not been examined for standards
by the National Park Service before the Senate acted on the proposal
and that the bill was hurried through that body. Asserting that
the proposed area was reported below standard by the National Park
Service, the association charged:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither of these Senators [Norbeck and Nye], nor the Public
Lands Committee which reported the bill and resolution, nor the
Senate sessions which carelessly passed them, discussed the
national aspects of this legislation. They did not consider the
plan and standards of the national system which Congress had
been building unit by unit, each painstakingly chosen, since 1872.
They ignored the half century Congressional custom of awaiting
the report of the Interior Department, to which Congress had entrusted
the System&rsquo;s shaping from the beginning. They ignored
the American people&rsquo;s enthusiastic interest in the plan and purpose
of this unique world-famous institution, and its insistence
in recent years upon park selection by the expert National
Park Service....</p>
<p>Thoughtlessness, apparently, but in practice this amounts to
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
localism defying national aspirations. It seriously threatens
national park standards.<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a></p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 16<span class="center"> BEN MILLARD (1872-1956)</span></p>
</div>
<p>In a letter to Robert S. Yard, Executive Secretary of the association,
Senator Norbeck accused the association of sending out a misleading
report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You criticise me for introducing and securing action in the Senate
on a bill fifteen days after it was introduced and especially in
view of the fact that it had not been investigated by the National
Park Service.</p>
<p>You could truthfully have said that this legislation has been
pending for a great many years&mdash;at least five years.</p>
<p>You could also have said that I have been trying all these years
to get the Park Service to investigate the proposed area.</p>
<p>You could also have added that the Government land in this
area was withdrawn by Presidential Proclamation many years
ago in anticipation of park legislation. Why carry the idea that
it was all a fifteen day affair when it is all of five years? It
would be a hard rule to apply that the failure of the Park Service
to investigate an important project should preclude a member
of Congress from taking any action whatever....</p>
<p>You also state that the project has been investigated by the Park
Service and reported adversely. It is an astonishing fact that
the knowledge of such reports should be withheld from me.
Therefore, I doubt very much that any report has been made.
I therefore wired the Park Service, asking who made the report
and when. I have no response.<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acting Director Arthur E. Demaray of the National Park Service,
meanwhile, wrote Norbeck advising him that the Service had never prepared
an official report on the park proposal and that the statement by
the association that the proposed park was &ldquo;reported below standard by
the National Park Service&rdquo; was without authority.<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a></p>
<p>In the House of Representatives where the proposal was considered
in the second session, the bill (S. 4385) underwent substantial revision.
After being considered by the Committee on the Public Lands, it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
reported out with amendments on February 19, 1929.<a class="fn" id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a> The revised
bill changed the boundary of the proposed area, reducing it from 69,120
acres to about 50,760 acres<a class="fn" id="fr_102" href="#fn_102">[102]</a> (50,830 acres according to another
source<a class="fn" id="fr_103" href="#fn_103">[103]</a>). The name was changed from Teton National Park to Badlands
National Monument. It modified the requirements for the road
which the state had to construct from 40 miles to 30 miles of total length.
The requirement that 90 percent of the privately owned lands had to be
acquired before the park could be established was dropped. Instead,
it was now at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior to decide when
enough privately owned lands within the proposed boundary had been
purchased so that the area could be proclaimed a national monument
by the President. As before, the bill stipulated that the lands would have
to be acquired without cost to the federal treasury. The amended bill
had a new provision that the Department of the Interior could grant hotel
and lodge franchises in advance of the fulfillment of the conditions.<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a></p>
<p>The amended bill was considered by the Committee of the Whole
House on February 25, six days after the Committee on the Public Lands
had acted on it. Two additional amendments were offered on the floor
of the House and were accepted. The idea that the Secretary of the
Interior could decide when enough privately owned land had been purchased
so that the area could be proclaimed as a national monument
was dropped in favor of requiring all privately owned land within the
proposed boundary be purchased before the area could be established.
The provision giving the Department of the Interior authority to grant
franchises in advance of the establishment of the national monument
was also deleted. This amended form passed the House of Representatives
on the same day, February 25.<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a></p>
<p>When the House act was referred to the Senate on the next day,
Norbeck asked his colleagues not to concur with the amended proposal.
He asked instead that the modified bill be considered in a conference
committee of the House and Senate.<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a> On March 2, the conference
committee recommended that the two amendments that were attached to
the bill on the floor of the House on February 25 be dropped, returning
the bill to the form it had when it was originally reported out on February
19.<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a></p>
<p>On the same day, March 2, the final bill was passed by both
houses.<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a> Known as Public Law No. 1021, the act authorizing Badlands
National Monument was approved by President Calvin Coolidge on
March 4, 1929. The signing of the act took place on the last day of
Coolidge&rsquo;s term as President of the United States.<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a></p>
<p>The area authorized under this act (45 Stat. 1553) included 50,830.40
acres; of this amount, 39,893.85 acres were in the public domain. The
remainder was state land or privately owned land.<a class="fn" id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Senator Norbeck introduced a new bill
(S. 5779) to establish Badlands National Monument on February 11, 1929.
It was identical with the House amendments proposed for S. 4385 which
were later reported out by the Committee on the Public Lands on February 19.
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
The new bill, after being referred to the Committee on Public
Lands and Surveys, was returned on February 20 with Senate Report
1842.<a class="fn" id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a> Meanwhile, Williamson introduced H. 17102 in the House,
which was identical to S. 5779; it was referred to the Committee on the
Public Lands.<a class="fn" id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a> Both of these bills died without further consideration.</p>

<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">THE DEPRESSION YEARS</span></h2>
<p>Among local persons who worked hard toward the establishment of
Badlands National Monument after it was authorized in 1929 were Ben
H. Millard, the original owner of Cedar Pass Lodge; A.G. Granger of
Kadoka; Leonel Jensen, local rancher; Ted E. Hustead, owner and operator
of the well-known Wall Drug Store; and Dr. G.W. Mills of Wall.<a class="fn" id="fr_113" href="#fn_113">[113]</a></p>
<p>Of these individuals, Mr. Millard made the greatest contribution to
the establishment and development of the national monument. Born September
15, 1872, in Minnesota, he moved to South Dakota in 1893 with
his parents. Millard entered the banking business in Sanborn County
in 1899. In 1917 he sold his banking interests and entered the State of
South Dakota Banking Department. On an assignment to Philip, South
Dakota, Millard first saw the Badlands and became interested in them.
He left the Banking Department and moved into the Badlands in 1927,
homesteading below Cedar Pass on the present site of Cedar Pass Lodge,
which he later built and operated.<a class="fn" id="fr_114" href="#fn_114">[114]</a></p>
<p>Millard worked closely with Senator Norbeck on development plans
for the proposed Badlands National Monument. From September 1934
through July 1936, he was employed as a local Resettlement Administration
project manager. In this capacity he was responsible for federal
acquisition of private lands, most of which later became part of the national
monument after it was established in 1939. The alignment of the
first Badlands road, alternate U.S. 16, was largely a result of his ideas.
In 1931 he selected what he believed to be the most scenic route, and
staked it out with the aid of his employee, E.N. &ldquo;Curley&rdquo; Nelson (who returned
to the Badlands in 1964 to become the first concessioner of Cedar
Pass Lodge). Millard and his sister, Mrs. Clara Jennings, and later his
son, Herbert, operated the Pinnacles concession from about 1935 to
1950.<a class="fn" id="fr_115" href="#fn_115">[115]</a> Three important parcels of land were donated by Millard to the
NPS in 1941, 1946, and 1955 for inclusion in Badlands National Monument.<a class="fn" id="fr_116" href="#fn_116">[116]</a>
Millard died at Cedar Pass Lodge in March 1956.</p>
<p>In special ceremonies on June 28, 1957, Millard Ridge, a prominent
portion of the Badlands wall six-tenths of a mile long just east of Cedar
Pass, was named and dedicated to his memory.<a class="fn" id="fr_117" href="#fn_117">[117]</a></p>
<p>In 1929 western South Dakota, in common with most of the farm belt,
had been suffering almost a decade from the deflation which followed
World War I. Both farmers and ranchers had been unable to fulfill
obligations assumed during an earlier period of high prices. Many of
the banks of the state were forced to close.<a class="fn" id="fr_119" href="#fn_119">[119]</a></p>
<p>With the beginning of the Great Depression in the fall of 1929, conditions
became increasingly worse. A combination of disasters which
included grasshopper infestations, crop failures, and drought struck the
country. The south central and western counties of the state were most
severely affected by these disasters.<a class="fn" id="fr_120" href="#fn_120">[120]</a></p>
<p>Several government programs on both the federal and state levels
were authorized to assist those in need. The NPS made use of a number
of these programs in various ways during the 1930&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>In November 1934, NPS Director Arno B. Cammerer recommended to
Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes that additional area be approved
for inclusion in the proposed Badlands National Monument. He contended
that the proposed additions, which included a portion of Sheep Mountain,
were as outstanding as the area originally authorized by Congress
in 1929. Wildlife problems and administrative difficulties of the originally
proposed area would be lessened by the change in boundary.<a class="fn" id="fr_121" href="#fn_121">[121]</a></p>
<p>In order to implement the proposed boundary change Mr. Cammerer
recommended (1) that the President should be asked to issue an Executive
Order withdrawing all public lands involved; (2) that all privately owned
lands be acquired through an existing federal government relief program;
and (3) that the next session of Congress be asked to establish the Badlands
National Monument with the boundaries now recommended.<a class="fn" id="fr_122" href="#fn_122">[122]</a></p>
<p>The Secretary of the Interior approved the proposal for the boundary
extension and in the same month President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered
that all unreserved and unappropriated public lands in Pennington,
Jackson, Fall River, and Custer Counties be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>temporarily withdrawn from settlement, location, sale, or entry,
for classification and use as a grazing project pursuant to the
submarginal land program of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration.<a class="fn" id="fr_123" href="#fn_123">[123]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By January 1, 1935, the NPS had already obtained options for 23,000
acres from private land owners living within the proposed boundary
extension area. This work was being done under the auspices of the
Land Program section of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration
(FERA) which had been authorized by Congress in 1933.<a class="fn" id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a></p>
<p>Early in April 1935, the NPS completed the &ldquo;Final Report on the Badlands
National Monument Extension Project, South Dakota R-1.&rdquo; The
report included both the area previously authorized under Public Law 1021
and the proposed extension. The area, to be known as the Badlands
Recreational Demonstration Project, would include 119,557.88 acres, of
which 72,316.22 were privately owned. The proposed boundary extension
received the support of Governor Tom Berry, Senator Norbeck,
President C.C. O&rsquo;Harra of the South Dakota School of Mines, and a
number of prominent geologists, naturalists, educators, and others.<a class="fn" id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a></p>
<p>In a letter to Harry L. Hopkins, FERA Administrator, on April 15, 1935,
Acting Secretary of the Interior T.A. Walters wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hereby recommend for purchase certain lands for a project
known as the Badlands National Monument Extension in Jackson,
Pennington, Washington and Washabaugh Counties, South
Dakota, proposed by the National Park Service of this Department
for the conservation and development of the natural resources
of the United States, within the meaning of Section 202
of Title II of the National Industrial Recovery Act, pursuant to
which funds have been allotted and transferred to the Land Program,
Federal Emergency Relief Administration.<a class="fn" id="fr_126" href="#fn_126">[126]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secretary Walters further stated that this project came within the
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
classification of lands as stated in a memorandum to him dated July
16, 1934. In it the Director of the Land Program said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="u">Demonstration Recreational Projects:</span> These include projects in
which the land to be purchased is to be used primarily for recreational
purposes, as submitted by the National Park Service,
Department of the Interior.<a class="fn" id="fr_127" href="#fn_127">[127]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Secretary of the Interior recommended that the Badlands National
Monument Extension be accepted as a Demonstration Recreational
Project of the Land Program, FERA. The project was approved and
adopted by the Land Program. The NPS expected that the cost of all
the lands considered would not average more than $2.66 per acre.<a class="fn" id="fr_128" href="#fn_128">[128]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, President Roosevelt, by a series of executive orders,
created the Resettlement Administration, an independent agency, and
transferred to it the land and related activities of the FERA. The Resettlement
Administration operated until the end of 1936 when its powers,
functions, and duties were transferred to the Secretary of Agriculture.
Later, the name &ldquo;Resettlement Administration&rdquo; was changed to the Farm
Security Administration.<a class="fn" id="fr_129" href="#fn_129">[129]</a></p>
<p>The work of appraising, securing options on, and purchasing private
lands, begun under the submarginal land program of the FERA, continued
under the Resettlement Administration.</p>
<p>In a 1935 letter to Assistant NPS Director Conrad L. Wirth, Senator
Norbeck pointed out some of the problems and drawbacks of the land
acquisition program by writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The land varies a great deal in quality, and the poor lands are
being obtained for the scheduled price, but the good lands are
not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He went on to say that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A very large percentage of this land, maybe thirty to fifty per
cent, is on the tax delinquency list, with about four years of
taxes. The price offered is less than the taxes held against the
land, and the owner is not anxious to sell if he cannot get a
nickel out of it....</p>
<p>Considerable of these lands, however, have already been abandoned
by the owner on account of the amount of taxes due.<a class="fn" id="fr_130" href="#fn_130">[130]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Counties were reluctant to sell land to the federal government because
this would mean withdrawal from the tax lists, thus reducing the
counties&rsquo; incomes. Norbeck recommended that the federal government
pay more for the land by a &ldquo;boost of one dollar an acre....&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_131" href="#fn_131">[131]</a> Meetings
were being held in various parts of the region to protest the low
prices being offered.<a class="fn" id="fr_132" href="#fn_132">[132]</a></p>
<p>The desperate situation of the times was expressed well in a letter
dated September 2, 1935, from a local rancher&rsquo;s wife who wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 6 years [of] crop failures on the so called submarginal land
of Western South Dakota we are facing financial disaster unless
we sell our land to the government.<a class="fn" id="fr_133" href="#fn_133">[133]</a></p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>During the same month, the average price being offered per acre
was $2.85.<a class="fn" id="fr_134" href="#fn_134">[134]</a></p>
<p>To gain Congressional approval for the boundary extension of the
proposed Badlands National Monument, the proponents secured the attachment
of a rider to the Taylor Grazing Bill revision authorizing the
enlargement. The grazing bill was vetoed in 1935 although there was
no opposition to the rider.<a class="fn" id="fr_135" href="#fn_135">[135]</a></p>
<p>The bill was reintroduced the following year and was passed. Approved
June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 1979), the law authorized the President to
round out the authorized national monument boundary by proclamation
within five years and stipulated that the entire area could not exceed
250,000 acres. Lands to be included must be &ldquo;adjacent or contiguous
thereto, ... including, but not being restricted to, lands designated as submarginal
by the Resettlement Administration....&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_136" href="#fn_136">[136]</a> This law gave
the NPS sufficient flexibility in fixing a suitable boundary.</p>
<p>Norbeck worked tirelessly in promoting every aspect of the area&rsquo;s
development until his death in December 1936. He actively participated
in securing aid from various governmental relief agencies for the land
acquisition program of the area, and for building roads, erecting buildings,
and other purposes.<a class="fn" id="fr_137" href="#fn_137">[137]</a></p>
<p>As early as February 1935 Governor Tom Berry of South Dakota
urged Secretary Ickes to establish the national monument formally
through a presidential proclamation. He pointed out that the basic
conditions of Public Law 1021 had been met: (1) a 30-mile highway,
built at a cost of approximately $320,000, starting at Interior and going
over Big Foot Pass and on to Sage Creek, was completed in 1935 by
the state and approved by the NPS; (2) the state had acquired such
privately owned lands within the area as were required by the Secretary
of the Interior.<a class="fn" id="fr_138" href="#fn_138">[138]</a></p>
<p>However, NPS Director Cammerer deferred making such a recommendation
until some 9,780 acres of state lands, located within the authorized
national monument boundary, had been transferred to the Service.<a class="fn" id="fr_139" href="#fn_139">[139]</a></p>
<p>Also, it was not until three years later, in 1938, that the United States
formally accepted title to 1,395.79 acres of land donated by the trustees
of the Custer State Park board who acted as purchasing agents for the
State of South Dakota. Senator Norbeck had been a member of this
board. The land was purchased from private owners with funds authorized
by the state legislature for the expressed purpose of fulfilling partial
requirements of Public Law 1021. Cost to the state was approximately
$12,000 for 1,280 acres of this donated land.<a class="fn" id="fr_141" href="#fn_141">[141]</a></p>
<p>By early July 1938 Director Cammerer considered that South Dakota
had met all the conditions of Public Law 1021. Under this act the federal
government had acquired title to about 48,000 acres of the 50,830 authorized.
Within the extension authorized by the act of June 26, 1936, the
NPS included an additional 97,976 acres. In all, the boundary recommended
by the Service included some 148,806 acres (later revised to
150,103.41, and still later revised again to 154,119.46 acres for the same
amount of land<a class="fn" id="fr_142" href="#fn_142">[142]</a>) of which the government owned 113,578.59 acres.
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
Director Cammerer therefore asked the Secretary of the Interior to approve
the establishment of the national monument and that a proclamation
be submitted to the President for final approval.<a class="fn" id="fr_143" href="#fn_143">[143]</a> On January 25,
1939, President Roosevelt formally proclaimed the establishment of Badlands
National Monument.<a class="fn" id="fr_144" href="#fn_144">[144]</a> It became the 77th national monument and
the 151st area in the federal park system which is administered by the
National Park Service.<a class="fn" id="fr_145" href="#fn_145">[145]</a></p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 19<span class="center"> UPPER (PINNACLES) TUNNEL, 1938</span></p>
<p class="pcapc">This 175-foot by 16-foot tunnel was located in the national monument about two miles
southeast of the present Pinnacles Ranger Station. It and Lower (Norbeck) Tunnel,
situated about three miles west of Cedar Pass Lodge near the base of Norbeck Pass,
were in use only about four years before being obliterated.<a class="fn" id="fr_140" href="#fn_140">[140]</a></p>
</div>
<p>The complicated land-ownership pattern in the national monument
along with grazing would plague the NPS for years. When the area
was proclaimed in 1939, the NPS administered substantial tracts of land
outside the national monument&rsquo;s boundary. These tracts were located
in the land utilization projects of the Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Soil
Conservation Service. On the other hand, the SCS had land utilization
tracts under its jurisdiction within the boundary.<a class="fn" id="fr_146" href="#fn_146">[146]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL MONUMENT</span></h2>
<p>Under the general direction of the NPS, various relief agencies such
as the Emergency Relief Administration (ERA), the Resettlement Administration,
the Works Progress Administration (WPA), and the Civilian Conservation
Corps (CCC) worked on development projects in the area.
Only a few scattered reports are now available on the work of these
agencies. About 150 persons were employed at the area in January 1937
on such projects as resurfacing, backsloping, ditching, and grading
roads.<a class="fn" id="fr_147" href="#fn_147">[147]</a> This included major reconstruction of the Sheep Mountain
Canyon road, completed the same year.<a class="fn" id="fr_148" href="#fn_148">[148]</a></p>
<p>One project of interest completed June 30, 1940 by ERA labor, under
the Public Roads Administration, was the obliteration of two tunnels
along the Pinnacles-Cedar Pass road. They were constructed during
the first half of the 1930&rsquo;s (see <a href="#fig19">Figure 19</a>) when the road was built by the
State of South Dakota; the road was completed in 1935. The tunnels
proved to be impractical because of inadequate width and maintenance
problems.<a class="fn" id="fr_149" href="#fn_149">[149]</a></p>
<p>In July 1940 the ERA project in the area was discontinued. Among
the types of work accomplished since July 1, 1938, when the project was
initiated, were the construction of five project headquarters buildings,
prospecting for water on the national monument, the development of a
well near the site of the old Pinnacles Checking Station, and ten road
jobs which included road construction, widening, graveling, building culverts,
and banksloping. The construction of parking overlooks, and the
obliteration of buildings and clearing of 16 farmstead tracts, also took
place during that time.<a class="fn" id="fr_150" href="#fn_150">[150]</a></p>
<p>During the 12 months between July 1939 and July 1940, the ERA project
employed an average of 150 relief workers.<a class="fn" id="fr_151" href="#fn_151">[151]</a></p>
<p>Since the national monument is located a relatively short distance
from Wind Cave National Park, the older area co-ordinated the business
of Badlands during its early years. On August 11, 1939, Chief Ranger
Howard B. Stricklin of Wind Cave became acting custodian of the newly
designated area and was later placed in charge of the local ERA and
CCC projects.<a class="fn" id="fr_152" href="#fn_152">[152]</a> Although the ERA project was terminated in July 1940,
the CCC work continued until June 1942.<a class="fn" id="fr_153" href="#fn_153">[153]</a></p>
<p>When Stricklin arrived to take charge, there were no living quarters
of any kind in the area. He lived at the CCC camp at Quinn Table while
his family remained at Wind Cave. Temporary offices were established
in Wall pending a decision regarding the location of permanent headquarters.<a class="fn" id="fr_154" href="#fn_154">[154]</a></p>
<p>Considerable thought was given to the selection of a headquarters
site. For a time the Pinnacles area was considered.<a class="fn" id="fr_155" href="#fn_155">[155]</a> However, in late
1939 it was finally decided to locate the center of operations at Cedar
Pass.<a class="fn" id="fr_156" href="#fn_156">[156]</a> This decision was due, in part, to the offer by Mr. Ben H. Millard,
owner of Cedar Pass Lodge,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to donate approximately 28 acres of strategically located land
in the Cedar Pass area to the Service to be used as a headquarters
area.<a class="fn" id="fr_157" href="#fn_157">[157]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="pcap">Figure 20<span class="center"> CEDAR PASS LODGE, early 1930&rsquo;s</span></p>
<p class="pcapc">The lodge was begun in 1928 at about the same time the large dance pavillion building
in the background was constructed. People from as distant as Rapid City came here
to dance to the music of Lawrence Welk and other name bands. More cabins for the
lodge were built from its lumber when the pavillion was removed in about 1934.<a class="fn" id="fr_159" href="#fn_159">[159]</a></p>
</div>
<p>The Department of the Interior accepted Millard&rsquo;s donation in May
1941.<a class="fn" id="fr_158" href="#fn_158">[158]</a></p>
<p>The decision to develop the Cedar Pass area for headquarters greatly
altered development plans. The CCC enrollees numbering 207 in
February 1940 were encamped at Quinn Table some 35 miles west of
Cedar Pass. Since much of the development was taking place at Cedar
Pass, it was necessary to drive them between these two points each
day.<a class="fn" id="fr_160" href="#fn_160">[160]</a></p>
<p>One of the great handicaps of Cedar Pass as a headquarters area
was the lack of water. To develop a satisfactory supply, the NPS found
it necessary to go to the White River, three miles south. One of the major
projects undertaken soon after selecting the headquarters site was to
dig a trench and lay pipe to the river. Since this stream is intermittent
above ground, but has a dependable subsurface flow, water was collected
in perforated pipes laid on hard clay and shale about eight feet
below the river bed. The pipe brought water to a sump on the river
bank where it was pumped to a 100,000-gallon storage tank above the
headquarters area.<a class="fn" id="fr_161" href="#fn_161">[161]</a> Work was begun on this reservoir in April 1940
and completed by the CCC in September 1941. At the same time the
CCC also erected a checking station at Pinnacles which Stricklin and
his family occupied from November 15, 1940, until about May 15, 1943.<a class="fn" id="fr_162" href="#fn_162">[162]</a></p>
<p>Handicapped by the location of the original CCC camp at Quinn
Table, a new camp was authorized at Cedar Pass and work on it began
in June 1941. Five months later the new camp was occupied.<a class="fn" id="fr_164" href="#fn_164">[164]</a></p>
<p>At that time the only visitor-contact point in the Cedar Pass area was
at Cedar Pass Lodge. During the summer season Mr. Millard lectured
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
nightly to lodge guests on the geologic history of the Badlands, thereby
initiating interpretive programs. He also showed movies of the Badlands
and other scenic areas. A temporary park ranger, who checked travel in
the Cedar Pass area during the day, took part in the evening programs.<a class="fn" id="fr_165" href="#fn_165">[165]</a></p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 21<span class="center"> PINNACLES RANGER STATION AND CHECKING STATION, 1941</span></p>
<p class="pcapc">Completed in 1941, the ranger station also served as quarters until January 1965 when
the new Pinnacles ranger station-residence was completed. The checking station was
removed about 1958 to make way for road improvement, and the old ranger station was
razed in April 1967.<a class="fn" id="fr_163" href="#fn_163">[163]</a></p>
</div>
<p>The problem of stock grazing in the national monument grew increasingly
worse during the 1940&rsquo;s. The acting custodian complained early
in 1940:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until the boundary is fenced and we are in a better position to
know what is private and what is monument land, there appears
to be very little that can be done to prevent this.<a class="fn" id="fr_166" href="#fn_166">[166]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In December 1941 he wrote in a similar vein:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During past winters it has been the practice of local stockmen
to allow herds of horses and cattle to drift into the monument
area to graze unrestrictedly over public as well as private lands
and along the monument highways. There is such a large
amount of private and county-owned land within the monument
boundaries (31,000 acres out of a total of 150,000) that it is difficult
to restrain stock from grazing on National Park Service land as
well as on the land that is owned or leased by private individuals.<a class="fn" id="fr_167" href="#fn_167">[167]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It soon became obvious that Badlands National Monument would be
a popular attraction because of its location near U.S. Highways 14 and
16, both well-known national highways going through the Black Hills.
In 1941 there were 70.02 miles of road in the national monument. Of this,
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
61.52 miles were constructed by the state and 8.5 miles by the federal
government; 29.87 miles were graveled and 40.15 were dirt roads.<a class="fn" id="fr_168" href="#fn_168">[168]</a></p>
<p>Although the roads through the area were only partially developed,
thousands of travelers turned off the through highways to view the scenic
Badlands.</p>
<p>Stricklin reported in September 1941:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than a quarter of a million visitors had passed through Badlands
National Monument by the close of the travel season on
September 30, representing an increase of approximately 30 percent
over the previous year, for the period during which an
actual count was made.<a class="fn" id="fr_169" href="#fn_169">[169]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entrance of the United States into World War II in December
1941 had a great impact on the area and its operations. Since many of
the CCC enrollees would be absorbed into the armed forces, the project
work soon came to an end. The acting custodian reported in the spring
of 1942, &ldquo;On March 25, after two years and five months of productive
work in Badlands National Monument, CCC Camp Badlands, NP-3
[located at Cedar Pass], was abandoned.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_170" href="#fn_170">[170]</a> Work was continued on
several projects undertaken at Camp Badlands by a CCC side camp
with the view toward completing the projects or leaving them &ldquo;in such
condition that the facilities involved may be used, and the materials, all
of which have been on hand for some time, may be protected against
deterioration and loss.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_171" href="#fn_171">[171]</a> However, the side camp was also closed in
the following June, leaving practically all of the construction projects in
various states of completion.<a class="fn" id="fr_172" href="#fn_172">[172]</a> In December 1942 most of the CCC buildings
at Cedar Pass were dismantled and removed by the armed services.<a class="fn" id="fr_173" href="#fn_173">[173]</a></p>
<p>Another result of the nation&rsquo;s entrance into the war was a sharp drop
in visitors to the Badlands. Stricklin wrote in June 1942 that &ldquo;Most of
these visitors appeared to be genuine vacationists ... [who] had a
vacation coming, and were trying to get it in before gas rationing became
nation-wide.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_174" href="#fn_174">[174]</a> He estimated that travel in March 1943 was 87 percent
under that for March 1942, and that &ldquo;All foreign [out-of-state] visitor cars
stopping for information were headed for defense jobs, or were military
personnel, changing their headquarters from one part of the country to
another.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_175" href="#fn_175">[175]</a> The effect of the war on travel to the national monument
is reflected in the travel figures of the area for the years from 1941 to
1945. (See <a href="#c9">Appendix A</a>.)</p>
<p>Efforts at the national monument during the war were devoted largely
to preventive maintenance. Changing his headquarters from Pinnacles
to Cedar Pass in June 1943, Stricklin was able to give closer attention
to the headquarters area.<a class="fn" id="fr_176" href="#fn_176">[176]</a> Such routine tasks as filling washouts,
cleaning ditches, reclaiming gravel, cutting roadside weeds, repairing
guard rails, cleaning up debris, and temporary patching of roads occupied
most of the staff&rsquo;s time. Other tasks, such as repairing water lines,
painting signs, keeping the buildings in repair, and servicing and repairing
the area equipment also required much attention.<a class="fn" id="fr_177" href="#fn_177">[177]</a> The cottage
that the custodian and his family rented from Millard at Cedar Pass was
destroyed by fire on November 27, 1943.<a class="fn" id="fr_178" href="#fn_178">[178]</a></p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 22<span class="center"> CEDAR PASS, June 1950</span></p>
<p class="pcapc">The buildings of Cedar Pass Lodge can be seen behind the white frame structure, which
served as a visitor center and headquarters until 1959. Remnants of two spires on
Vampire Peak remain on the left. It was observed on November 22, 1950, that one of the
two spires of this famous landmark had fallen, apparently during a thunder storm.<a class="fn" id="fr_189" href="#fn_189">[189]</a></p>
</div>
<p>During the ten years following the end of World War II, there was
slow progress in the area&rsquo;s development. Work on the custodian&rsquo;s residence
at Cedar Pass, begun in 1941, was completed in 1946.<a class="fn" id="fr_179" href="#fn_179">[179]</a> Early
in 1953 two additional houses, both prefabricated, were completed.<a class="fn" id="fr_180" href="#fn_180">[180]</a>
In January 1948 commercial power was brought to Cedar Pass and Interior
with the completion of a single-phase power line by the Rural
Electrification Administration.<a class="fn" id="fr_181" href="#fn_181">[181]</a> The Northwestern Bell Telephone Company
extended telephone service to the national monument headquarters
in September 1952.<a class="fn" id="fr_182" href="#fn_182">[182]</a> (This service was officially taken over by the
Golden West Telephone Cooperative, Inc., in October 1960.)<a class="fn" id="fr_183" href="#fn_183">[183]</a></p>
<p>During the travel seasons of 1946 and 1947 there was much adverse
criticism of the national monument roads. The maintenance equipment
was in poor condition and usually undergoing repairs when most
needed.<a class="fn" id="fr_184" href="#fn_184">[184]</a> In the summer of 1948 about 4 miles of road was black-topped
between the Cedar Pass junction and Norbeck Pass; this represented
the first paving of U.S. Route 16A in the national monument.<a class="fn" id="fr_185" href="#fn_185">[185]</a>
The present northeast entrance road, about 3&frac12; miles long, was completed
in October 1951. It opened up a new area of the Badlands known
as the Window Section.<a class="fn" id="fr_186" href="#fn_186">[186]</a> This road was made possible by the donation
in 1946 of a 160-acre, strategically located land parcel by Mr. Ben Millard
who had purchased it from Jackson County in March 1941 for this purpose.<a class="fn" id="fr_187" href="#fn_187">[187]</a></p>
<p>During the late 1940&rsquo;s and early 1950&rsquo;s buildings constructed as temporary
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
structures in the ERA and CCC period were remodeled and continued
in use for headquarters and utility purposes.<a class="fn" id="fr_188" href="#fn_188">[188]</a></p>
<p>Both the grazing and the land ownership problems at the national
monument were compounded by the war. With increased rainfall in
the region during the decade of the 1940&rsquo;s and the rising price of beef,
the situation of the ranchers greatly improved. Under a plan suggested
by Congressman Case in January 1943 to help in the &ldquo;Beef for Victory
Program,&rdquo; the Service authorized for the first time in April the issuance
of grazing permits on federally owned grasslands within the national
monument. Under this program, the lands were divided into seven grazing
units. An orderly grazing plan was established with the cooperation
of the Soil Conservation Service.<a class="fn" id="fr_190" href="#fn_190">[190]</a> Stricklin was able to identify and
locate all cattle and sheep outfits that claimed to be using the national
monument lands in conjunction with their SCS allotments.<a class="fn" id="fr_191" href="#fn_191">[191]</a> Following
the war authorized grazing remained one of the area&rsquo;s major management
problems for over a decade.</p>
<p>Stricklin wrote about an interesting sidelight of the grazing problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The roundup and disposal of several hundred head of unclaimed
and so-called wild horses in the Sage Creek basin was a source
of much concern on the part of both ranchers and the Custodian,
the ranchers claiming the wild stallions were enticing away
their mares. The Custodian&rsquo;s concern was partly because of the
damage these herds were doing to the range, but largely because
it was practically the only program of any kind on which
the National Park Service and the ranchers could even remotely
agree. Several roundups were collaborated in, during which the
herds were drastically reduced. Airplanes were used on at
least one of the roundups to flush horses out of the canyons and
keep them from breaking back on their route to Scenic and the
loading chutes. Jack and Mamie Close, ranchers on Quinn
Table, were the leaders among the ranchers in this work.<a class="fn" id="fr_192" href="#fn_192">[192]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feral horses were eventually eliminated through roundups and returned
to their owners. The last roundup took place in the national
monument in 1963.<a class="fn" id="fr_193" href="#fn_193">[193]</a></p>
<p>With the improvement of their lot, many ranchers who had been
destitute only a few years earlier were in a position to purchase county
lands within the national monument boundary. The custodian reported
in April 1943 that practically all such land within the boundary was leased
for grazing and that much of it was recently bought by sheep and
cattle ranchers.<a class="fn" id="fr_194" href="#fn_194">[194]</a> In 1946 Stricklin reported a considerable change in
land ownership where much of the land formerly controlled by Pennington
County had passed into private ownership.<a class="fn" id="fr_195" href="#fn_195">[195]</a> Later the same year
Jackson County auctioned all of its 3,000 acres of land within the boundary
to private individuals. Practically all of the 14,000 acres which was
owned by the two counties two years earlier had passed into private
ownership.<a class="fn" id="fr_196" href="#fn_196">[196]</a></p>
<p>The location of the boundary had been a subject of discussion since
the national monument was established in 1939. The area contained a
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
large acreage of grassland which the Soil Conservation Service believed
should be released for grazing purposes. There was also overlapping
jurisdiction between the two federal agencies.<a class="fn" id="fr_197" href="#fn_197">[197]</a></p>
<p>After several years of study, the NPS and the SCS arrived at an
understanding on the national monument boundary and mutual land
problems. In 1946 the two agencies signed an agreement known as
<b>Recommended Program of Procedure</b> for boundary adjustment of Badlands
National Monument. The NPS agreed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="revint">(1) to transfer to the Soil Conservation Service NPS lands outside
the existing national monument boundary in order to compensate
for 1,220 acres the SCS had turned over for inclusion
in the national monument prior to its establishment in 1939;</p>
<p class="revint">(2) to transfer to the SCS equivalent lands (computed on a livestock-carrying-capacity
basis) for lands that were to be acquired
from the SCS by the NPS as the result of revised boundary
studies;</p>
<p class="revint">(3) to transfer to the SCS federal lands which the NPS planned
to eliminate from the national monument to use in exchange
for non-federal lands remaining in the national monument
after the boundary changes were made.<a class="fn" id="fr_198" href="#fn_198">[198]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plan made it possible to transfer, without legislation, 3,678.19
acres of NPS lands lying outside the park boundary to the SCS. This
was done by order of the Secretary of the Interior in July 1949.<a class="fn" id="fr_199" href="#fn_199">[199]</a> These
lands were acquired under the Resettlement Administration program
and, in 1936 were transferred to the NPS. When Badlands National
Monument was established in 1939, these lands were not within the
boundary.<a class="fn" id="fr_200" href="#fn_200">[200]</a></p>
<p>In order to carry out the main objectives of the plan, Congressional
action was necessary. In 1950 bills (H.R. 7342 and S. 3081) were introduced
in the 81st Congress by Representative Case and Senator Chandler
Gurney to implement the proposed land exchange. H.R. 7342 was passed
by the House without amendment, but later the bill died in the Senate.
The senate bill (S. 3081) was not considered.</p>
<p>In 1951 Senator Francis H. Case, who had just been elected to that
office, and Congressman E.Y. Berry introduced identical bills (S. 896 and
HR. 3540) in the 82nd Congress. These were similar to the ones proposed
a year earlier. Berry&rsquo;s bill passed the House on July 2, 1951, without
amendment. The House Act was referred to the Senate Committee
on Interior and Insular Affairs, which recommended that section five of
H.R. 3540 be dropped. This section would have provided authority to
include 4,000 acres of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the Sheep
Mountain area provided certain conditions were met. The committee
believed &ldquo;that a satisfactory solution should be worked out with the
Tribal Council of the Oglala Sioux Tribe of Indians, and any others
interested, before legislation with regard to these lands is enacted.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_201" href="#fn_201">[201]</a>
The bill in its amended form, including another minor change recommended
by the committee, passed the Senate on January 24, 1952.<a class="fn" id="fr_202" href="#fn_202">[202]</a></p>

<p>Shortly afterwards on February 8, telegrams were sent to Congressmen
Berry, Senator Case, and Senator Karl Mundt by the executive committee
of the tribal council of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. The messages
urged the congressmen to do their best to get Section 5 restored so it
would be possible for the tribe to negotiate with the federal government
for exchange of the land in the Sheep Mountain area for other lands.<a class="fn" id="fr_204" href="#fn_204">[204]</a>
The House, however, did not heed this resolution but voted instead to
concur with the Senate&rsquo;s amended version. The bill became Public Law
328 after being signed by President Harry S Truman on May 7, 1952.<a class="fn" id="fr_205" href="#fn_205">[205]</a></p>
<p>Under this law, the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to adjust
and redefine at his discretion the exterior boundary of the national monument
by appropriate reductions or additions. The law specified, among
other things, that the adjusted area could not exceed the existing 154,119
acres.<a class="fn" id="fr_206" href="#fn_206">[206]</a> (An official figure of 150,103.41 acres was used as the total
acreage of the area at the time it was proclaimed as a national monument
in 1939. A revised figure, listing 154,119.46 acres for the same area,
was used as the total acreage from about 1943 until October 1952.<a class="fn" id="fr_207" href="#fn_207">[207]</a>)</p>
<p>Immediately after the bill became law, proposed boundary changes
received considerable attention. Some believed that the area of the
national monument should be reduced. A strong supporter of this view
was the South Dakota Stock Growers Association. It was the organization&rsquo;s
belief that the size could be reduced by about one-half without
destroying any of its scenic value. They estimated that 3,000 head of
cattle would be without grass if the NPS carried through its plan to fence
the area and eliminate grazing from the national monument. One of the
biggest problems was the large acreage of private lands located within
its boundary. Many ranchers believed that these lands ought to be
eliminated &ldquo;from the Badlands National Monument wherever a reasonable
boundary adjustment can be made.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_208" href="#fn_208">[208]</a> Others contended &ldquo;that
all of the grassland west of Pinnacles [Sage Creek Basin] could be removed
from the Park and that such removal would in no way destroy
the attraction to the tourist.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_209" href="#fn_209">[209]</a></p>
<p>A 1953 memorandum from the Regional Director to NPS Director
Conrad L. Wirth explained how Sage Creek Basin had become largely
government-owned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sage Creek Basin was a submarginal waste in the 1930&rsquo;s due to
prolonged and severe drought conditions and considerable
acreages of private lands were acquired by the Resettlement
Administration in connection with its submarginal land program....
Other private parcels became tax delinquent and were ultimately
sold to private owners by Pennington County in the
1940&rsquo;s. Because of favorable climatic conditions of the past
several years, the basin has recovered from its condition of the
1930&rsquo;s; it now contains a considerable acreage of good grasslands....
We venture the opinion that had vegetative conditions
of the basin in the 1930&rsquo;s resembled those of today, a submarginal
land program would not have been undertaken so far
as the basin is concerned.<a class="fn" id="fr_210" href="#fn_210">[210]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Owing to the great interest generated by the proposed boundary
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
changes, the NPS issued a statement in July 1952 giving reasons why it
would not be &ldquo;advisable to eliminate from the Monument the grasslands
west of the Pinnacles, as suggested by the South Dakota Stock Growers
Association.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_211" href="#fn_211">[211]</a> It said in part that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These flatter lands with their cover of native grasses and wildflowers,
typical of the surrounding prairie country, are valuable
for park and wildlife purposes. The preservation of this relatively
small exhibit of native grass is an important responsibility
in itself, since no comparable section of the Great Plains has
been set apart to be preserved in its natural condition.<a class="fn" id="fr_212" href="#fn_212">[212]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statement also indicated that about 31,700 acres of other lands
were to be eliminated from the national monument, including more than
12,000 acres of privately owned lands. It indicated that the Soil Conservation
Service agreed to these revisions and that they were &ldquo;the same
as those which the Congress considered when it authorized boundary
revisions by enacting Public Law 328.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_213" href="#fn_213">[213]</a></p>
<p>On October 3, 1952, Assistant Secretary of the Interior Joel D. Wolfsohn
issued an order revising the boundary of the national monument.
The order showed that 30,802.52 acres, more or less, were &ldquo;hereby transferred
from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture
for use, administration, and disposition in accordance with the
provisions of Title III of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act....&rdquo;
This reduced the size of Badlands National Monument, according to the
order, to 121,883.12 acres.<a class="fn" id="fr_214" href="#fn_214">[214]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Order was performed to provide lands for the Soil Conservation
Service to enable those persons having private land in the
monument to trade for Soil Conservation Service lands outside
the monument, and to make a few administrative adjustments in
the monument boundary.<a class="fn" id="fr_215" href="#fn_215">[215]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, discrepancies in the land records led the NPS to investigate
the status of lands within the former boundary.<a class="fn" id="fr_216" href="#fn_216">[216]</a> By late 1953 it
was found that 31,442.52 acres were eliminated from the national monument
by the October 3 order instead of 30,802.52 acres. Of these
12,916.32 acres were private lands; the remaining 18,526.20 acres were
transferred to the Soil Conservation Service of the Department of Agriculture.<a class="fn" id="fr_217" href="#fn_217">[217]</a></p>
<p>There were also lands totaling about 4,449 acres added to the national
monument by the October 3 order; these lands included</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;2,581.88 acres of public domain, 336.88 acres of purchased land,
981.79 acres of Soil Conservation Service land and 548.56 acres
of private land.... The net result of the boundary adjustments
was a loss of 26,993.23 acres of land in Badlands National Monument.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_218" href="#fn_218">[218]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even before the October 3 order was enacted there was already talk
about further reduction of the area boundary. In a memorandum dated
December 5, 1952, Director Wirth wrote to the Regional Director in charge
of Badlands National Monument:</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 24<span class="center"> A PORTION OF SAGE CREEK BASIN</span></p>
<p class="pcapc">In 1953 over 25,000 acres were recommended by the NPS for deletion from this section
of the national monument.<a class="fn" id="fr_219" href="#fn_219">[219]</a> Later, studies revealed that the area should be retained.
Today it is home for bison, deer, pronghorn, prairie dogs, and other animals. Sage Creek
Primitive Campground is located in its northwest section.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The basis for a final solution [of the boundary problem at Badlands
National Monument] lies in a reassessment and restatement
of Monument objectives and significance. If it is found, as
appears likely, that our chief concern and purpose should be
with the badlands formations, then the boundaries should be
drawn accordingly, with due regard for badlands protection,
interpretation and attendant development needs. If we are to
retain some or all of the grasslands, we must have strong and
valid justification for doing so and be prepared to disclose and
defend what specific Monument purposes and uses they are to
serve.<a class="fn" id="fr_220" href="#fn_220">[220]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to determine if the grasslands west of Pinnacles should be
kept, the NPS contracted with a number of prominent scientists to make
studies of the area in 1953. Dr. Theodore E. White, a paleontologist with
the Smithsonian Institution, determined in June 1953 whether or not
potentially fossiliferous areas would be excluded by proposed boundary
readjustments.<a class="fn" id="fr_221" href="#fn_221">[221]</a> Late that summer archeological investigations were
undertaken by Archeologist Paul L. Beaubien of the NPS Regional Office
in Omaha, Nebraska. He recorded some 30 prehistoric Indian sites
and one historic Indian site believed to have been used by Chief Big
Foot&rsquo;s band a few days before the infamous battle at Wounded Knee in
December 1890.<a class="fn" id="fr_222" href="#fn_222">[222]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Professor F.W. Albertson of Fort Hays Kansas State College submitted
a <b>Report of Study of Grassland Areas of Badlands National Monument</b>
in September. In brief he said, &ldquo;it seems to me that the Park Service
has an extremely interesting area, which should be preserved for
all interested public through the years to come.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_223" href="#fn_223">[223]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, support grew for retention of the boundaries as spelled
out by the October 3, 1952, secretarial order. The Rapid City Chapter of
the Izaak Walton League of America, the South Dakota State Highway
Commission, the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks,
the Black Hills and Badlands Association, and prominent local persons,
including Sid Soma, Dr. G.W. Mills, Ted Hustead, and Leonel Jensen, all
from the town of Wall, were but a few of the many who advocated retention
of the present boundary.<a class="fn" id="fr_224" href="#fn_224">[224]</a></p>
<p>Although the South Dakota Stock Growers Association and some
local ranching interests continued to advocate &ldquo;the transfer of administration
of all grazing lands within the monument not needed for road
and development purposes,&rdquo; it became evident to these people that opposition
was building up against further acreage reduction in the park.<a class="fn" id="fr_225" href="#fn_225">[225]</a></p>
<p>In April 1954 the NPS recommended no boundary changes until the
problem was explored further. Director Wirth said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it seems apparent that there is a very considerable number of
people ... which strongly support the retention of the Badlands
National Monument not only as a striking example of geological
formations, with areas of paleontological interest, but also for
preservation of a segment of the plains grassland and native
wildlife as added attractions. On the other hand, there is also
a difficult problem of inholdings and grazing complications,
with strong sentiment from the livestock owners for a reduction
of the Monument.<a class="fn" id="fr_226" href="#fn_226">[226]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He recommended, among other things, that exchanges of private land
inside the boundary for federal lands outside be pushed vigorously,
and that Dr. Adolph Murie, NPS Biologist, should study the wildlife possibilities
of the national monument.<a class="fn" id="fr_227" href="#fn_227">[227]</a></p>
<p>In his report Dr. Murie said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Badlands National Monument has national significance, first of
all because it is a sample of the Badlands. The values of this
monument are of outstanding significance in the fields of geology,
paleontology, archeology, and biology. The eroded terrain
has scenic value for many, and in Sage Creek Basin and in
the section north of Cedar Pass one finds the atmosphere of the
early scene, when this country was far beyond the frontier....</p>
<p>In Sage Creek Basin we have an opportunity to preserve the
prairie dog-blackfooted ferret community, with many other associated
species of the region.... Likewise the rare kit fox may
possibly be preserved in the basin. The value of Sage Creek
Basin for preserving these rare native species is contingent
on size and its present size is none too large....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Concerning boundaries in general over the monument it appears
that any eliminations would be harmful to public values. Only
in minor details, in connection with land adjustments, should
any territory be sacrificed. Sage Creek Basin, especially,
should not be reduced....<a class="fn" id="fr_228" href="#fn_228">[228]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also during the summer of 1954, the NPS requested Dr. James D.
Bump, Director of Museum of Geology of the South Dakota School of
Mines and Technology at Rapid City, to make a geological and paleontological
appraisal of Badlands National Monument. Quotations from his
report point out his strong feelings for the area:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Big Badlands of South Dakota, from a paleontological standpoint,
probably constitutes the richest Oligocene region in the
world.... [The quantity of] paleontological materials given
up to man over the past 100 years is of astounding proportions.
This prehistorical treasure represents more than 250 species of
the vertebrate life of thirty million years ago....</p>
<p>The Badlands National Monument is a part of the greatest badland-eroded
section in North America.... I can think of no
other geographic area of like-size that has the unusual natural
beauty, the undisturbed plant and animal life and the wealth of
scientific information to offer the public....<a class="fn" id="fr_229" href="#fn_229">[229]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He ended his report by making a number of recommendations, some
of which follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The present boundaries must remain intact. Removal of any
lands, except perhaps some thin scattered fringes, would seriously
cripple future development and greatly reduce the attractiveness
of the Monument....</p>
<p>Under no circumstances should any part of the Sage Creek Basin
be withdrawn. Its scientific and natural value cannot be overestimated
and it is my opinion that this section will in the
future become one of the most interesting and educational of
the entire Monument.<a class="fn" id="fr_230" href="#fn_230">[230]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of Dr. Murie&rsquo;s wildlife study and Dr. Bump&rsquo;s geological
and paleontological appraisal, the Service began formulating definite
ideas in April 1955 concerning further revision of the boundary. An
elimination of 11,124 acres including 4,234 acres of privately owned lands
was proposed. This is only about one-third of the 32,000 acres which
was being widely talked about as a possible reduction in size during
1953. The larger reduction would have included much of the grasslands
west of Pinnacles. Addition of 4,460 acres, including 3,954 acres of Pine
Ridge Indian Reservation lands and 246 acres of Department of the
Army lands located on the Indian reservation, was also proposed. Net
reduction in area would be about 6,664 acres.<a class="fn" id="fr_231" href="#fn_231">[231]</a></p>
<p>Since the mid-1930&rsquo;s there have been various suggestions that a
road be constructed to connect Sage Creek Basin with the Sheep Mountain
locality. Although it was not in the master plan for the national
monument in the 1950&rsquo;s, planning for the ultimate boundary was done
so that the road could be built if ultimately needed.<a class="fn" id="fr_232" href="#fn_232">[232]</a> However, Dr.
Murie recommended against the road proposal in his report.<a class="fn" id="fr_233" href="#fn_233">[233]</a></p>

</div>
<p>On April 12, 1956, an open meeting was held in Wall, South Dakota,
to discuss proposed boundary changes with ranchers, stockmen, and
local businessmen. No opposition to the proposals was voiced. The
meeting also provided an opportunity for discussion of development
plans, including fencing and grazing matters.<a class="fn" id="fr_234" href="#fn_234">[234]</a></p>
<p>On March 22, 1957, Acting Secretary of the Interior Hatfield Chilson
issued an order eliminating 11,234.09 acres from the national monument,
of which about 4,000 acres were private land. The total area of Badlands
National Monument was fixed at 111,529.82 acres. This also included
an addition of 240 acres of federal land which, among other things, increased
the utility area at headquarters and provided a much needed
disposal area. An additional 1.39 acres of federal land, located along
the White River three miles south of headquarters, were added, since
water storage tanks and a water pump, all part of the area&rsquo;s water system,
are located there. More than 7,000 acres of the 11,234.09-acre reduction
were transferred to the Department of Agriculture, under provisions
of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, and became available for exchange
for private land remaining inside the new boundary. As a result
of the secretarial order, there was a net reduction of 10,992.70 acres in
the size of the national monument. The new boundary included 98,486.39
acres in federal ownership and 13,043.43 acres of non-federal land.<a class="fn" id="fr_235" href="#fn_235">[235]</a>
Since then, the Service has acquired title to 6,356.71 acres of the non-federal
land within the boundary. As of December 1967 there were
104,843.10 acres of federal land and 6,686.72 acres of non-federal land
within the boundary of Badlands National Monument.<a class="fn" id="fr_236" href="#fn_236">[236]</a></p>
<p>On January 2, 1954, the Secretary of Agriculture transferred the Land
Utilization Program, including lands in the vicinity of the national monument,
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
from the Soil Conservation Service to the U.S. Forest Service.<a class="fn" id="fr_237" href="#fn_237">[237]</a>
This, in part, prompted a <b>Program of Procedure for Land Exchanges</b>, a
revision of the <b>Recommended Program of Procedure</b>, to be drafted. The
new agreement was signed in September 1954 by officials of both services.
It states in part that all future land exchanges are to be handled
by the Forest Service. This includes exchanges with private parties
who own land inside the national monument boundary. One objective
of such land exchanges is to eliminate all non-federal lands from within
Badlands National Monument.<a class="fn" id="fr_238" href="#fn_238">[238]</a> Since 1954 elimination of such lands
has come about largely through exchanges, although in a few instances
actual purchases were made.</p>

</div>
<p>Concurrently with boundary adjustments, the NPS gave considerable
thought to a grazing management plan for the area whereby grazing
might be eliminated without serious hardship to the local ranchers. As
a result the Service presented a plan in May 1948 to grazing permittees
outlining a schedule for the gradual termination of grazing on federally
owned national monument lands by December 31, 1961.<a class="fn" id="fr_239" href="#fn_239">[239]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">MISSION 66 DEVELOPMENT</span></h2>
<p>In 1956, the National Park Service launched a 10-year park conservation
development program known as Mission 66. This was to have
great impact on the national monument. Under the program an expenditure
of nearly $5,000,000 for roads, trails, buildings, and utilities was planned.
Among the major projects undertaken and completed between 1956
and 1960 were a realinement and oil surfacing of main roads, the development
of the Conata Picnic Area and the Cedar Pass and Dillon
Pass campgrounds, and the erection of utility and storage buildings,
three multiple-housing units, five employee residences, and an amphitheater.<a class="fn" id="fr_240" href="#fn_240">[240]</a></p>
<p>In May 1955 the Millard family donated two tracts of land totaling
18.50 acres to the NPS. Of this total, 5.85 acres, located in front of Cedar
Pass Lodge, were donated for the right-of-way of the relocated highway;
the remaining 12.65 acres made possible the development of Cedar Pass
Campground.<a class="fn" id="fr_241" href="#fn_241">[241]</a></p>
<p>The visitor center was completed in May 1959. This large structure
houses the national monument headquarters, interpretive exhibits, and
an audiovisual presentation of the Badlands story.<a class="fn" id="fr_242" href="#fn_242">[242]</a></p>
<p>The installation of exhibits in the visitor center was essentially completed
by November 1960.<a class="fn" id="fr_243" href="#fn_243">[243]</a> Some of the materials used in the exhibits
were donated by a number of individuals and institutions. Mr. Herbert
Millard, son of the late Ben Millard, gave a large mass of sand calcite
crystals now in the Small Wonders Exhibit. Dr. Winter of the University
of South Dakota at Vermillion donated the plant collection in the Great
Plains Grasslands Exhibit. The mounted badger in the Wildlife of the
Grassland Exhibit was a gift from Orville Sandall of Kadoka, South
Dakota. The skull of an Audubon Bighorn, on display above the Breaks
in the Grassland Exhibit, was donated by Willard Sharp of Interior,
South Dakota. In the exhibit showing a number of Indian artifacts are
casts of early-man points donated by the University of Nebraska State
Museum.<a class="fn" id="fr_244" href="#fn_244">[244]</a></p>
<p>The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in Rapid City,
South Dakota, donated both the lower jaw and the upper jaw, including
skull, of a fossilized titanothere, which is in the Badlands Bones Exhibit.
The materials for the articulated oreodont fossil in the same exhibit were
also donated by the school. The oreodont fossil is of particular interest
because it was found northwest of Imlay, South Dakota about 100 feet
from where a famous fossilized oreodont with unborn twins was excavated.
The latter fossil is on display at the Museum of Geology at
the school (see <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>).<a class="fn" id="fr_245" href="#fn_245">[245]</a></p>
<p>The first full-time resident park naturalist for Badlands National
Monument was assigned in June 1958 to aid with the local interpretive
program.<a class="fn" id="fr_246" href="#fn_246">[246]</a> For a number of years previously, a park naturalist who
had been assigned to Black Hills areas of the NPS also served the national
monument on an irregular basis.<a class="fn" id="fr_247" href="#fn_247">[247]</a></p>

</div>
<p>On September 16, 1959, following the completion of the visitor center,
the NPS dedicated Badlands National Monument. The featured speaker
for the event was Fred A. Seaton, Secretary of the Interior, who gave the
dedicatory address. Some 350 persons attended the ceremony.<a class="fn" id="fr_248" href="#fn_248">[248]</a></p>
<p>Tragedy struck a short time prior to the dedication with the sudden
death of Superintendent George H. Sholly on August 19. As a tribute
to him, the new amphitheater was named the George H. Sholly Memorial
Amphitheater.<a class="fn" id="fr_249" href="#fn_249">[249]</a></p>
<p>After the boundary of Badlands National Monument was redefined
by secretarial order in March 1957, the NPS began a long-range program
for fencing it. The first segment of fencing was completed in 1957. By
early 1961 some 108 miles were fenced with 20 miles still to be completed.
To fence non-federal land excluding state land within the national
monument would require an additional 92 miles of fence.<a class="fn" id="fr_252" href="#fn_252">[252]</a></p>
<p>In December 1961 letters were delivered to all inholding owners and
to all persons who grazed stock within the national monument in that
year. The letters terminated all grazing on federal lands within Badlands,
and gave a short history of grazing in the national monument, the
reason for termination, and the objectives and plans of the Service now
that grazing was no longer permitted. Most of the private land located
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
inside the boundary was not fenced, so unless steps were taken to fence
the tracts used for grazing, stock would still trespass on federally owned
lands.<a class="fn" id="fr_253" href="#fn_253">[253]</a> Superintendent John W. Jay and Chief Park Ranger James F.
Batman attended the legislative-committee meeting of the South Dakota
Stockgrowers Association in Rapid City on November 30, 1961, where the
matter of fencing the inholdings was discussed. Although at the time
of this meeting the Service had no plans to fence any of the private
inholdings, it later decided to assist with the fencing on an equal cost-sharing
basis in the interest of better landowner-Service relations and in
consideration of special situations relating to livestock management that
faced some of the owners of private land in the national monument.<a class="fn" id="fr_254" href="#fn_254">[254]</a>
This offer was made to the landowners by letter from Superintendent Jay
dated May 9, 1962. As a result three landowners accepted the offer.<a class="fn" id="fr_255" href="#fn_255">[255]</a>
By 1964 all of the inholdings on which grazing was being done were
fenced either on a 50-50 basis or by the individual owners.<a class="fn" id="fr_256" href="#fn_256">[256]</a></p>

</div>
<p>Despite the Service&rsquo;s hope that grazing on the national monument&rsquo;s
federally owned land would be terminated at the end of 1961, it continued.
Due to drought conditions of 1961 and early 1962, Congressman
Berry requested on behalf of the ranchers that grazing be continued during
1962. NPS Director Wirth decided to set up an emergency grazing
program that would include only those ranchers who held permits in
1961. Accordingly, special-use permits were issued to 26 ranchers during
1962. This was the last year that grazing was permitted on federally
owned lands in the national monument.<a class="fn" id="fr_257" href="#fn_257">[257]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Some livestock trespassing by local ranchers continued, nevertheless.
In November 1962, the United States Attorney took direct action against
five ranchers who had been in trespass for some time.<a class="fn" id="fr_258" href="#fn_258">[258]</a></p>
<p>As early as 1919 a U.S. Forest Service report expressed the idea that
&ldquo;Sage Creek Basin contains a large acreage of land that can be used
for a game preserve for buffalo, elk, deer, antelope and mountain
sheep.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_259" href="#fn_259">[259]</a> In 1935 the proposed Badlands National Monument plus the
Badlands Recreational Demonstrational Area (most of which was later
included in the national monument when it was established in 1939)
were considered to be favorable localities for the reintroduction of buffalo,
mountain sheep, and pronghorn.<a class="fn" id="fr_260" href="#fn_260">[260]</a></p>
<p>However, after the national monument was established, the NPS
believed that the area was too small to provide a wildlife range.<a class="fn" id="fr_261" href="#fn_261">[261]</a> Dr.
Murie&rsquo;s report</p>
<blockquote>
<p>recommended that no buffalo be introduced on the monument
because of the artificial conditions under which they would have
to be maintained. If it were deemed desirable to fence an
area for buffalo the most suitable spot would be north of Cedar
Pass.<a class="fn" id="fr_262" href="#fn_262">[262]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concerning bighorn sheep he &ldquo;recommended that the bighorn be
introduced when the opportunity develops, and that Sheep Mountain
Peak be added to the monument for the use of the bighorn.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_263" href="#fn_263">[263]</a></p>
<p>Pronghorn, commonly referred to as antelope, were seen during the
1940&rsquo;s on rare occasions in Badlands National Monument and just outside
the north boundary. However since 1959, 100 or more head have
been reported annually in the national monument. These animals have
come from the outside since there has not been any formal reintroduction
of pronghorn inside the boundary.<a class="fn" id="fr_264" href="#fn_264">[264]</a></p>

<p class="pcapc">After an absence of about a century, buffalo were reintroduced into the national monument
in 1963. The fast-increasing herd roams largely in the 45,000 acres of Sage Creek
and Tyree Basins.<a class="fn" id="fr_268" href="#fn_268">[268]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after grazing was terminated on national monument
lands in 1962, the range underwent a remarkable recovery, due to the
abundant rainfall of the 1962 and 1963 seasons. Questions arose as to
why the range was not being utilized. Superintendent Frank Hjort recommended
that bison be reintroduced as a means of getting the wildlife
restoration program underway.<a class="fn" id="fr_265" href="#fn_265">[265]</a></p>
<p>In November 1963 the first herd of bison, comprised of 28 head from
Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial Park in North Dakota and Fort
Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge in Nebraska, were released in Sage
Creek Basin. In October of the following year, this herd was enlarged
by an additional 25 head from Theodore Roosevelt. The herd has done
well and by the end of 1967 numbered 122 individuals.<a class="fn" id="fr_266" href="#fn_266">[266]</a></p>
<p>Since 1963 the buffalo have shown that they prefer the remoteness
of Sage Creek Basin and have demonstrated little desire to leave that
area.<a class="fn" id="fr_267" href="#fn_267">[267]</a></p>
<p>In January 1964 in cooperation with the South Dakota Game, Fish
and Parks Department, bighorn sheep were reintroduced. Twelve head
of Rocky Mountain Bighorns from Colorado were released in a 370-acre
holding pen with the view toward eventually restocking Badlands National
Monument and other parts of South Dakota. This flock was supplemented
by ten more animals the following month.<a class="fn" id="fr_270" href="#fn_270">[270]</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, losses were suffered by both adults and lambs during
the first two and one-half years. The situation improved early in 1966
with no further losses until the summer of 1967 when the peak flock of
27 individuals suffered a severe setback. In September, when all but
13 had succumbed to a respiratory infection, the bighorn were released
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
from the holding pasture. They now roam the rugged Badlands south
of Pinnacles Overlook.<a class="fn" id="fr_271" href="#fn_271">[271]</a></p>
<p>In February 1964, the NPS purchased Cedar Pass Lodge, together
with 72 acres of the surrounding land, for $275,000 from the Millard family.
The lodge is now being run on a contract basis by a concessioner.<a class="fn" id="fr_272" href="#fn_272">[272]</a></p>
<p>Increased travel to the area during the years of Mission 66 fully
justified the expanded development program of the national monument.
From 1956 to 1966 the number of visitors increased 65 percent (see <a href="#c9">Appendix A</a>).</p>
<p>Because of this great increase in travel, the summer visitor may find
some of the scenic-overlook parking areas full, the visitor center crowded,
and the nightly campground amphitheater program with &ldquo;standing room
only.&rdquo; Since increased visitor use is practically assured in the foreseeable
future, plans are already being made to provide additional facilities
for visitors to Badlands National Monument.</p>

<p>Average annual increase in number of visits in the last 15 years has

<p>In September 1954, 15&frac12; years after the national monument was
established, the five millionth visit was recorded. A total of ten million
visits was attained just seven years later in July 1961. On August 16,
1966, Superintendent Frank A. Hjort officially welcomed a traveler and
his family who represented the 15 millionth visit to Badlands National

Monument. At the present rate of travel increase, the 20 millionth visit
is expected in 1970. As of December 31, 1967, the total number of visits
to the national monument since its establishment in 1939 is 16,991,394.</p>
<p>The NPS travel year has been the same as a regular calendar year
since January 1, 1953. Before that date, the NPS travel year was from
October through September. However, total visits prior to 1953 have

published new evidence found in the Gibbs map to back up the opposite
interpretation of Clyman&rsquo;s journals. He now believes that the Smith party
followed the White River exclusively, keeping to the north bank all the
way to possibly near the mouth of Willow Creek, located east and a little
south from the present town of Hot Springs, South Dakota. This means
the party would have at least seen, and perhaps passed through the present
Badlands National Monument. [Dale L. Morgan and Carl I. Wheat,
